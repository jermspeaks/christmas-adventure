The village baker in Starlight Hollow who runs "Elara's Enchanted Bakery," a cozy cottage with a sign in cheerful, hand-painted letters.

Their bakery is warm and inviting, with copper pots hanging from the ceiling and a large wooden table covered in flour. Elara makes magical pastries—gingerbread men that dance and sugar cookies that sing—though these abilities have been lost as the magic fades. They are knowledgeable about Christmas magic, having studied it for years to understand how it works. Elara is thoughtful, helpful, and provides important information about the fading magic and the Memory Vault.

## Kvothe

The guardian of the Memory Vault, initially introduced as a mysterious figure cloaked in shadows that seem to move independently, with their face hidden beneath a hood. Kvothe has the coldest, emptiest eyes, and their presence creates an intense feeling of emptiness, like standing in a void where nothing exists, not even hope. Initially, Kvothe believes Christmas is a waste and that the magic is better off locked away to protect people from disappointment. However, through the story, Kvothe transforms from this cold, shadowy guardian into a warm, human person who remembers what Christmas really means. After their transformation, Kvothe becomes the guardian of balanced magic, helping magic flow and helping people find joy. Kvothe's transformation is central to the story's resolution.
