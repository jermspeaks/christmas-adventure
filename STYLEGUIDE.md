# Style Guide: Christmas Adventure Story

This style guide establishes the writing standards for our cozy, magical Christmas choose-your-own-adventure story. The tone and style are inspired by "The Spellshop" by Sarah Beth Durst and "The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches" by Sangu Mandanna.

---

## 1. Tone & Voice

### Core Principles
- **Cozy and Magical**: The story should feel warm, inviting, and infused with wonder
- **Light-hearted and Fun**: Maintain a playful, joyful atmosphere throughout
- **Warm and Inviting**: Readers should feel welcomed into the story world
- **Balanced Humor**: Blend whimsical elements with light, gentle humor—never mean-spirited or cynical

### Voice Characteristics
- Conversational and approachable
- Enthusiastic but not overwhelming
- Comforting, like a warm cup of cocoa on a cold night
- Wonder-filled without being saccharine

**Example of good tone:**
> The snowflakes drifted down like tiny, frozen stars, each one catching the light from the windows of the cottage ahead. You could almost hear them whispering secrets as they landed on your coat. *This is magical,* you thought, and you weren't entirely sure if you meant the snowflakes or the whole evening.

**Avoid:**
> The snow fell heavily, obscuring your vision and making the path treacherous.

---

## 2. Point of View & Tense

### Perspective
- **Second Person ("You")**: The story directly addresses the reader as the protagonist
- **Past Tense**: All narrative should be written in past tense
- **Direct Address**: Use "you" to create an immersive, interactive experience

### Guidelines
- Use "you" consistently throughout sections
- Avoid switching to third person or first person
- Keep the reader as the active participant in the story

**Example:**
> You stepped through the doorway and found yourself in a room that seemed to stretch far beyond what the cottage's exterior suggested. *This can't be right,* you thought, but there it was—walls lined with bookshelves that reached toward a ceiling you couldn't quite see, each shelf crammed with volumes whose spines were cracked and pages yellowed with age.

**Avoid:**
> The character stepped through the doorway... (third person)
> I stepped through the doorway... (first person)

---

## 3. Internal Thoughts & Character Reflection

### Using Internal Thoughts in Second Person
- **Italics for Thoughts**: Use italics to show the reader's internal thoughts and reactions
- **Deeper Reflection**: Incorporate moments of introspection and character reflection while maintaining "you" POV
- **Natural Integration**: Weave thoughts seamlessly into the narrative, not as separate blocks
- **Personality Through Thoughts**: Let internal thoughts reveal personality, quirks, and emotional responses

### Guidelines
- Use italics (*like this*) for direct internal thoughts
- Balance internal thoughts with action and dialogue—don't overuse
- Internal thoughts should feel natural and conversational, not overly formal
- Use thoughts to show reactions, doubts, realizations, and personality quirks
- Thoughts can be brief fragments or longer reflections, depending on the moment

### When to Use Internal Thoughts
- Moments of realization or understanding
- Reactions to surprising or magical events
- Brief doubts or reassurances
- Personality quirks and character voice
- Emotional responses that enhance immersion

**Example of internal thoughts:**
> You stepped through the doorway and found yourself in a room that seemed to stretch far beyond what the cottage's exterior suggested. *This can't be right,* you thought, but there it was—walls lined with bookshelves that reached toward a ceiling you couldn't quite see. The air smelled of old paper and something else, something that made your skin tingle. *Magic. It has to be magic.*
>
> You reached out to touch one of the books, then hesitated. *What if it's a trap?* But the books looked so inviting, their spines worn and friendly. *Oh, what's the worst that could happen?* You pulled one from the shelf.

**Example of personality through thoughts:**
> The cat on the windowsill turned to look at you, its eyes twinkling with an intelligence that seemed far beyond ordinary. "You're late," it said.
>
> *Late for what?* you wondered. *I didn't know I had an appointment with a talking cat.* But you kept that thought to yourself. "I'm sorry," you said instead. "I didn't realize—"
>
> "The cocoa's getting cold," the cat interrupted, and you realized there was indeed a steaming mug on the table that hadn't been there a moment before. *Well, that's convenient.* You reached for it, still processing the fact that you were having a conversation with a feline.

**Example of brief, punchy thoughts:**
> The door creaked open. *Here goes nothing.* You stepped inside.
>
> Or:
>
> You stared at the present. *It has my name on it. How is that possible?*

**Avoid:**
> You thought to yourself that this was strange. (Too formal, breaks immersion)
> You were thinking about how weird this all was. (Telling instead of showing)

## 4. Description & Atmosphere

### Approach
- **Rich and Immersive**: Paint vivid pictures that engage all the senses
- **Sensory Details**: Include sights, sounds, smells, textures, and even tastes where appropriate
- **Lived-in Feel**: Settings should feel real and inhabited, not sterile or empty
- **Christmas Integration**: Weave traditional Christmas elements naturally throughout
- **Specific Over Generic**: Use concrete, evocative details rather than vague descriptions
- **Layered Details**: Build atmosphere by layering multiple sensory impressions

### Description Guidelines
- Show, don't tell—let readers experience the world through details
- Use specific, evocative language rather than generic terms
- Balance description with action—don't let it slow the pace too much
- Create atmosphere through careful word choice
- Include specific, tangible objects that readers can picture clearly
- Reference concrete memories, objects, or details that make the world feel real
- Layer sensory details naturally—don't list them mechanically

### Specific Details That Bring Scenes to Life
- **Concrete Objects**: Instead of "some books," use "a leather-bound copy of *The Grimoire on Plantwork* with dog-eared pages"
- **Precise Memories**: Reference specific past experiences that feel real and lived-in
- **Tangible Textures**: Describe how things feel, not just how they look
- **Specific Sounds**: Use onomatopoeia and precise sound descriptions ("clanks and squeaks and whirrs" rather than "noisy")
- **Named Items**: Give objects names or specific characteristics that make them memorable

**Example of rich, layered description:**
> The kitchen smelled of cinnamon and vanilla, with a hint of something magical you couldn't quite name. A kettle whistled merrily on the stove—a copper kettle with a dent on one side and a handle wrapped in red-and-white striped cloth. Through the window, you could see snowflakes dancing in the golden light of streetlamps, each one catching the light like tiny, frozen stars. The worn wooden table in the center of the room was set with mismatched mugs: one with a chip on the rim that you recognized from your grandmother's collection, another painted with tiny snowflakes, and a third that seemed to change color as you looked at it. *That's definitely magical,* you thought, reaching for the snowflake mug instead.

**Example of specific, evocative details:**
> You reached out and touched the garland draped over the mantel. The pine needles were soft and fragrant, releasing their fresh scent as your fingers brushed against them—the same scent that reminded you of Christmas mornings when you were small, when your father would bring in the tree and the whole house would smell like a forest. The twinkling lights woven through the branches cast warm, shifting shadows on the wall, and you noticed that one of the ornaments was a hand-painted ceramic bird, its wings spread as if it might take flight at any moment.

**Example of layered sensory details:**
> The Christmas market stretched before you, each stall glowing with warm light. The air was filled with the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and somewhere in the distance, you could hear carolers—their voices blending in harmony, though you couldn't quite make out the words. Your boots crunched on the fresh snow as you walked, and when you reached out to touch a display of hand-knitted scarves, the wool was so soft it felt like touching a cloud. But there was something else, too—a shimmer in the air that made everything feel just a little bit more magical, like the world itself was holding its breath in anticipation.

**Example of specific objects and memories:**
> You stepped into the cottage and immediately noticed the bookshelf that took up most of one wall. It wasn't just any bookshelf—it was crammed with volumes that looked ancient, their spines cracked and their pages yellowed. One book caught your eye: *The Manipulation of Weather Patterns, a Study of the Effects of Spellwork on the Breeding Habits of Eastern Puffins.* You'd never heard of it, but something about the title made you smile. Next to it sat a wooden carving in the shape of a mermaid, its paint faded but still beautiful, and you found yourself wondering about the person who had placed it there, what story it might hold.

**Avoid:**
> The room had some furniture and decorations. (Too vague)
> You saw things that looked nice. (No specific details)
> The kitchen smelled good. (What does it smell like? Be specific)

---

## 5. Magical Elements

### Philosophy
- **Grounded and Subtle**: Magic should feel natural, not outlandish
- **Integrated into Daily Life**: Magic enhances ordinary moments rather than replacing them
- **Enhancement, Not Domination**: The story is about people and relationships; magic is the seasoning, not the main course

### What's Appropriate
- Talking animal familiars (wise, witty, or sassy companions)
- Objects with subtle magical properties (a kettle that always has hot cocoa, books that rearrange themselves)
- Gentle transformations (snow that sparkles unusually, lights that respond to mood)
- Small, practical magic that makes life more delightful

### What to Avoid
- Epic fantasy scale (no world-ending threats, no massive battles)
- Overly complex magic systems with strict rules
- Magic that solves every problem instantly
- Dark or dangerous magic that creates fear or tension

**Example of grounded magic:**
> The cat on the windowsill turned to look at you, its eyes twinkling with an intelligence that seemed far beyond ordinary. "You're late," it said, its voice like the tinkling of tiny bells. "The cocoa's getting cold."

**Avoid:**
> The wizard raised his staff and cast a spell that split the sky in two, revealing the realm of the gods beyond.

## 6. Dialogue

### Style
- **Witty**: Characters should be clever and quick with words
- **Warm**: Dialogue should feel friendly and inviting
- **Occasionally Sassy**: A bit of playful attitude adds personality
- **Natural Flow**: Conversations should feel real, not stilted or overly formal
- **Character-Driven**: Each character's speech should reflect their unique personality, quirks, and background
- **Playful Banter**: Use witty exchanges and playful back-and-forth to create engaging interactions

### Guidelines
- Each character should have a distinct voice that readers can recognize
- Dialogue should reveal character personality, quirks, and relationships
- Keep it conversational—people don't always speak in complete sentences
- Use dialogue to show relationships and create connection
- Let characters reveal themselves through what they say and how they say it
- Include personality quirks in speech patterns (anxiety, humor, formality, etc.)
- Use dialogue tags and actions to enhance character voice, not just "said"

### Making Dialogue Witter and More Character-Driven
- **Personality Quirks**: Give characters speech patterns that reflect their nature (anxious characters might ramble, confident ones might be direct)
- **Playful Banter**: Create back-and-forth exchanges that show relationships and add humor
- **Revealing Details**: Let characters reveal information about themselves through their speech
- **Natural Interruptions**: People interrupt each other, finish each other's sentences, or respond to unspoken cues
- **Subtext**: Sometimes what characters don't say is as important as what they do say

**Example of witty, character-driven dialogue:**
> "Oh, you found the secret passage!" The woman's eyes crinkled with delight. "I was wondering when you'd stumble across that. Most people take at least three tries."
> 
> "You mean other people have been here?" you asked.
> 
> "Well, not *people* exactly," she said with a wink. "But close enough. The last one was a talking cat, and before that, a very determined raven. You're the first human in, oh, let's see..." She tapped her chin. "Three years? Four? Time gets a bit fuzzy when you're surrounded by magic."

**Example of sassy, personality-driven dialogue:**
> The raven on the bookshelf ruffled its feathers. "Oh, wonderful. Another one who thinks they're special. Let me guess—you're here to save Christmas?"
> 
> "I—" you started.
> 
> "No, wait, let me try again." The raven hopped to a higher perch. "You're here because you followed some twinkling lights and got lost. Am I close?"
> 
> "Actually, that's pretty accurate," you admitted.
> 
> "Of course it is. Happens every year." The raven's voice softened slightly. "But you know what? The lost ones are usually the most interesting. So, what brings you to my library?"

**Example of playful banter:**
> "You're late," the cat said, its tail twitching.
> 
> "Late for what?" you asked. *I didn't know I had an appointment with a talking cat.*
> 
> "For cocoa, obviously." The cat gestured with a paw toward a steaming mug that definitely hadn't been there a moment before. "I've been keeping it warm, but my patience—and my magic—has limits."
> 
> "I'm sorry, I didn't realize—"
> 
> "That's what they all say." The cat's eyes narrowed, but you could have sworn it was suppressing a smile. "Just drink it before it gets cold. Again."

**Example of character quirks through dialogue:**
> The spider plant rustled its leaves nervously. "We're going to die," it informed you, its voice shaking. "Absolutely, one hundred percent, we are going to die."
> 
> "The fighting won't come here," you said, trying to sound reassuring.
> 
> "The fighting is *already* here!" The plant shook so hard that several leaves detached and floated to the floor. "Gah, I'm shedding! This is exactly what I was afraid of. Stress-induced leaf loss. I read about this in *The Complete Guide to Plant Anxiety*—"
> 
> "You need to think about something else," you interrupted gently. "Oak trees are struck by lightning more often than any other tree. Apples can float because they are twenty-five percent air."
> 
> "Unless the outside is on fire," the plant said miserably. "How fast do they chirp if it's all on fire?"

**Avoid:**
> "Hello," the character said. "How are you?" (Too formal, no personality)
> "I am here to help you," the wizard said. (Stilted, no character voice)
> All characters sounding the same (No distinct voices)

## 7. Sentence Variety & Rhythm

### The Power of Varied Sentence Structure
- **Mix Short and Long**: Combine short, punchy sentences with longer, flowing ones to create rhythm
- **Pacing Control**: Use sentence length to control the pace—short sentences for urgency, long ones for contemplation
- **Emotional Impact**: Vary structure to match the emotional tone of the moment
- **Reading Rhythm**: Create a natural, engaging reading experience through varied sentence patterns

### When to Use Short Sentences
- Moments of realization or surprise
- Action sequences or urgent moments
- Emphasis on a particular thought or feeling
- Creating tension or suspense
- Quick, punchy dialogue tags or reactions

### When to Use Long Sentences
- Descriptive passages that build atmosphere
- Moments of reflection or contemplation
- Layering multiple sensory details
- Creating a flowing, dreamy quality
- Building up to a revelation or important moment

### Guidelines
- Don't use all short sentences—it can feel choppy
- Don't use all long sentences—it can feel overwhelming
- Vary structure within paragraphs, not just between them
- Match sentence structure to the content and mood
- Use fragments sparingly for emphasis

**Example of varied sentence structure:**
> You stepped through the doorway. *This can't be right.* The room stretched far beyond what the cottage's exterior suggested, its walls lined with bookshelves that reached toward a ceiling you couldn't quite see, each shelf crammed with volumes whose spines were cracked and pages yellowed with age. The air smelled of old paper and something else, something that made your skin tingle. Magic. It had to be magic.
>
> You reached out to touch one of the books, then hesitated. *What if it's a trap?* But the books looked so inviting, their spines worn and friendly, like old friends waiting to share their secrets. *Oh, what's the worst that could happen?* You pulled one from the shelf.

**Example of short sentences for impact:**
> The door creaked open. *Here goes nothing.* You stepped inside.
>
> Or:
>
> You stared at the present. *It has my name on it. How is that possible?*

**Example of long sentences for atmosphere:**
> The Christmas market stretched before you, each stall glowing with warm light that cast dancing shadows on the fresh snow, and the air was filled with the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, with something else underneath—a hint of cinnamon and vanilla and something magical you couldn't quite name, while somewhere in the distance you could hear carolers, their voices blending in harmony though you couldn't quite make out the words, and your boots crunched on the snow as you walked, and when you reached out to touch a display of hand-knitted scarves, the wool was so soft it felt like touching a cloud.

**Example of mixing for rhythm:**
> The cat on the windowsill turned to look at you. Its eyes twinkled with an intelligence that seemed far beyond ordinary, and you found yourself wondering if you were imagining things, if maybe you'd had too much eggnog, if perhaps this whole evening was some kind of elaborate dream. "You're late," it said, its voice like the tinkling of tiny bells.
>
> *Late for what?* you wondered. *I didn't know I had an appointment with a talking cat.*
>
> "The cocoa's getting cold," the cat continued, gesturing with a paw toward a steaming mug that definitely hadn't been there a moment before, and you realized that whether this was real or a dream, you were definitely going to drink that cocoa.

**Avoid:**
> You walked into the room. You saw a table. You saw a chair. You saw a window. (Too choppy, all short sentences)
> You walked into the room and you saw a table and you saw a chair and you saw a window and everything looked nice. (Too repetitive, no variety)
> You walked into the room that had a table and a chair and a window, and everything looked nice, and you felt happy, and you decided to sit down, and then you noticed something else. (Too long, no breaks)

## 9. Choice Presentation

### Evolution of Choices
- **Early Choices**: Playful and experimental—let readers explore and have fun
- **Later Choices**: More consequential as the story progresses—decisions should matter
- **Tone Matching**: Choice text should match the tone of the section
- **Meaningful Engagement**: Choices should feel important, not arbitrary

### Choice Guidelines
- Present 2-3 choices per section (when applicable)
- Make each choice distinct and appealing in its own way
- Avoid choices that are obviously "right" or "wrong"
- Choice text should be clear and enticing

**Example of playful early choice:**
> - Follow the twinkling lights deeper into the garden

## 10. Christmas Themes

### Traditional Elements
- Decorations: twinkling lights, garlands, ornaments, wreaths
- Traditions: gift-giving, caroling, holiday baking, tree decorating
- Settings: cozy cottages, snowy streets, Christmas markets, warm kitchens
- Atmosphere: warmth, togetherness, wonder, anticipation

### Holiday Magic
- The magic of the season should feel special and meaningful
- Christmas traditions can have magical twists
- The wonder of the holidays should enhance the magical elements
- Themes of giving, connection, and joy should shine through

### Integration
- Weave Christmas elements naturally—don't force them
- Let the holiday atmosphere enhance the cozy, magical tone
- Use Christmas as a backdrop, not the entire focus
- Balance holiday-specific content with universal themes

**Example:**
> The Christmas market stretched before you, each stall glowing with warm light that cast dancing shadows on the fresh snow. The air was filled with the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and somewhere in the distance, you could hear carolers—their voices blending in harmony, though you couldn't quite make out the words. Your boots crunched on the snow as you walked, and when you reached out to touch a display of hand-knitted scarves, the wool was so soft it felt like touching a cloud. But there was something else, too—a shimmer in the air that made everything feel just a little bit more magical, like the world itself was holding its breath in anticipation.
