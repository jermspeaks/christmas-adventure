# Style Guide: Christmas Adventure Story

This style guide establishes the writing standards for our cozy, magical Christmas choose-your-own-adventure story. The tone and style are inspired by "The Spellshop" by Sarah Beth Durst and "The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches" by Sangu Mandanna.

---

## 1. Tone & Voice

### Core Principles
- **Cozy and Magical**: The story should feel warm, inviting, and infused with wonder
- **Light-hearted and Fun**: Maintain a playful, joyful atmosphere throughout
- **Warm and Inviting**: Readers should feel welcomed into the story world
- **Balanced Humor**: Blend whimsical elements with light, gentle humor—never mean-spirited or cynical

### Voice Characteristics
- Conversational and approachable
- Enthusiastic but not overwhelming
- Comforting, like a warm cup of cocoa on a cold night
- Wonder-filled without being saccharine
- Dry, witty observations throughout the narrative, not just in dialogue
- Gentle sarcasm and playful asides that add personality

### Humor Through Dry Observations
- **Narrative Wit**: Use dry, witty observations in the narrative voice, not just in dialogue
- **Gentle Sarcasm**: Employ light, playful sarcasm that adds personality without being mean-spirited
- **Witty Asides**: Include parenthetical asides or brief observations that add humor and character
- **Understated Humor**: Sometimes the funniest moments are the most understated
- **Character Voice Through Humor**: Let humor reveal character personality and perspective

**Example of good tone:**
> The snowflakes drifted down like tiny, frozen stars, each one catching the light from the windows of the cottage ahead. You could almost hear them whispering secrets as they landed on your coat. *This is magical,* you thought, and you weren't entirely sure if you meant the snowflakes or the whole evening.

**Example of dry observations and witty asides:**
> The meeting was always on the third Thursday of every third month, but that was just about the only thing that never changed. They never met in the same place twice; the last meeting had been in someone's front room with freshly baked scones, and the time before that had been in a garden full of sunshine. *This* meeting, on a cold, wet October afternoon, happened to be taking place on a tiny, abandoned pier in the Outer Hebrides.
>
> A pier. In the Outer Hebrides. In *October*.
>
> Of course, they weren't actually called the Very Secret Society of Witches. They weren't called anything at all, which was why you'd decided to come up with a name for them yourself. You had cycled through several alternatives first, like the League of Extraordinary Witches and the Super Secret Society of Witchy Witches. You were still rather fond of the latter.
>
> The ridiculous names were mostly to annoy Primrose, the ancient and very proper head of the group, a position Primrose had presumably bestowed upon herself at some point in the past hundred years or so. (This might have been something of an exaggeration on your part, but it was impossible to tell how old Primrose really was. She wouldn't say.)

**Example of gentle sarcasm:**
> You found it difficult to believe anyone had been able to resist Primrose's persuasions (which an uncharitable person might say better resembled genteel bullying), but still, it was rather comforting to know that this small, soaked group on the pier wasn't all that was left of you.
>
> Or:
>
> Primrose, of course, was an exception to the Rules. You supposed it was just one of the many privileges of being the oldest, most powerful, and most bossy.

**Example of witty narrative observations:**
> Jamie loved Ian dearly, but Christ, it was like the man had wandered straight out of a book of poetry and no one had had the good sense to send him back in.
>
> Or:
>
> A message that began with the words *WITCH WANTED*, presented just like that in all capitals like it was announcing the birth of a new royal baby, should have gone straight into the bin. You knew, even as you clicked on the message out of pure curiosity, that it would probably be some kind of invitation to partake in kinky witch sex with the sender.
>
> Imagine your surprise, then, to discover it was, in fact, even weirder than that.

**Avoid:**
> The snow fell heavily, obscuring your vision and making the path treacherous.
> Mean-spirited or cynical humor that undermines the cozy tone

---

## 2. Point of View & Tense

### Perspective
- **Second Person ("You")**: The story directly addresses the reader as the protagonist
- **Past Tense**: All narrative should be written in past tense
- **Direct Address**: Use "you" to create an immersive, interactive experience

### Guidelines
- Use "you" consistently throughout sections
- Avoid switching to third person or first person
- Keep the reader as the active participant in the story

**Example:**
> You stepped through the doorway and found yourself in a room that seemed to stretch far beyond what the cottage's exterior suggested. *This can't be right,* you thought, but there it was—walls lined with bookshelves that reached toward a ceiling you couldn't quite see, each shelf crammed with volumes whose spines were cracked and pages yellowed with age.

**Avoid:**
> The character stepped through the doorway... (third person)
> I stepped through the doorway... (first person)

---

## 3. Internal Thoughts & Character Reflection

### Using Internal Thoughts in Second Person
- **Italics for Thoughts**: Use italics to show the reader's internal thoughts and reactions
- **Deeper Reflection**: Incorporate moments of introspection and character reflection while maintaining "you" POV
- **Natural Integration**: Weave thoughts seamlessly into the narrative, not as separate blocks
- **Personality Through Thoughts**: Let internal thoughts reveal personality, quirks, and emotional responses

### Guidelines
- Use italics (*like this*) for direct internal thoughts
- Balance internal thoughts with action and dialogue—don't overuse
- Internal thoughts should feel natural and conversational, not overly formal
- Use thoughts to show reactions, doubts, realizations, and personality quirks
- Thoughts can be brief fragments or longer reflections, depending on the moment

### When to Use Internal Thoughts
- Moments of realization or understanding
- Reactions to surprising or magical events
- Brief doubts or reassurances
- Personality quirks and character voice
- Emotional responses that enhance immersion

**Example of internal thoughts:**
> You stepped through the doorway and found yourself in a room that seemed to stretch far beyond what the cottage's exterior suggested. *This can't be right,* you thought, but there it was—walls lined with bookshelves that reached toward a ceiling you couldn't quite see. The air smelled of old paper and something else, something that made your skin tingle. *Magic. It has to be magic.*
>
> You reached out to touch one of the books, then hesitated. *What if it's a trap?* But the books looked so inviting, their spines worn and friendly. *Oh, what's the worst that could happen?* You pulled one from the shelf.

**Example of personality through thoughts:**
> The cat on the windowsill turned to look at you, its eyes twinkling with an intelligence that seemed far beyond ordinary. "You're late," it said.
>
> *Late for what?* you wondered. *I didn't know I had an appointment with a talking cat.* But you kept that thought to yourself. "I'm sorry," you said instead. "I didn't realize—"
>
> "The cocoa's getting cold," the cat interrupted, and you realized there was indeed a steaming mug on the table that hadn't been there a moment before. *Well, that's convenient.* You reached for it, still processing the fact that you were having a conversation with a feline.

**Example of brief, punchy thoughts:**
> The door creaked open. *Here goes nothing.* You stepped inside.
>
> Or:
>
> You stared at the present. *It has my name on it. How is that possible?*

**Avoid:**
> You thought to yourself that this was strange. (Too formal, breaks immersion)
> You were thinking about how weird this all was. (Telling instead of showing)

---

## 4. Opening Techniques

### Starting Strong
- **Specific, Concrete Details**: Begin with a specific, concrete detail that immediately grounds the reader in the scene
- **Natural Expansion**: Let context unfold naturally from that initial detail
- **Immediate Engagement**: Hook the reader with something tangible and interesting
- **Avoid Info-Dumps**: Don't start with exposition or backstory—let it emerge organically

### Opening Strategies
- Start with a specific detail (a time, a place, an object, a rule)
- Use that detail to naturally introduce context and setting
- Build outward from the concrete to the abstract
- Create curiosity through specificity

**Example of strong opening:**
> The meeting was always on the third Thursday of every third month, but that was just about the only thing that never changed. You'd been told to meet at different locations each time—last time it had been in someone's front room with freshly baked scones, and the time before that had been in a garden full of sunshine. *This* meeting, on a cold, wet October afternoon, happened to be taking place on a tiny, abandoned pier in the Outer Hebrides.
>
> A pier. In the Outer Hebrides. In *October*.

**Example of opening with a specific object:**
> The letter had arrived three days ago, but you'd been carrying it around in your pocket ever since, its edges now soft and worn from being unfolded and refolded so many times. *WITCH WANTED*, it said in all capitals, like it was announcing the birth of a new royal baby. You'd almost thrown it away, but something—curiosity, maybe, or the way the paper seemed to shimmer slightly in the light—had made you keep it.

**Example of opening with a rule or expectation:**
> You'd been told that witches were always supposed to lead separate lives. No visits, no texts, no emails—nothing that could lead anybody from one witch to another. Too much magic left unchecked in one place, you'd been warned, would draw attention. For the sake of all of you, you had to stay apart.
>
> But here you were, standing on a pier in the Outer Hebrides with twenty other witches, and you couldn't help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, the rules were more flexible than you'd been led to believe.

**Avoid:**
> You were a witch, and witches had to follow certain rules. (Too abstract, no concrete detail)
> Once upon a time, in a magical world... (Too generic, cliché opening)

---

## 5. Description & Atmosphere

### Approach
- **Rich and Immersive**: Paint vivid pictures that engage all the senses
- **Sensory Details**: Include sights, sounds, smells, textures, and even tastes where appropriate
- **Lived-in Feel**: Settings should feel real and inhabited, not sterile or empty
- **Christmas Integration**: Weave traditional Christmas elements naturally throughout
- **Specific Over Generic**: Use concrete, evocative details rather than vague descriptions
- **Layered Details**: Build atmosphere by layering multiple sensory impressions

### Description Guidelines
- Show, don't tell—let readers experience the world through details
- Use specific, evocative language rather than generic terms
- Balance description with action—don't let it slow the pace too much
- Create atmosphere through careful word choice
- Include specific, tangible objects that readers can picture clearly
- Reference concrete memories, objects, or details that make the world feel real
- Layer sensory details naturally—don't list them mechanically

### Specific Details That Bring Scenes to Life
- **Concrete Objects**: Instead of "some books," use "a leather-bound copy of *The Grimoire on Plantwork* with dog-eared pages"
- **Precise Memories**: Reference specific past experiences that feel real and lived-in
- **Tangible Textures**: Describe how things feel, not just how they look
- **Specific Sounds**: Use onomatopoeia and precise sound descriptions ("clanks and squeaks and whirrs" rather than "noisy")
- **Named Items**: Give objects names or specific characteristics that make them memorable
- **Named Objects with Personality**: Objects with names (like "the Broomstick" for a car, or "Nowhere House" for a location) add charm, personality, and memorability

### Named Objects
- **Personality Through Naming**: Giving objects names makes them feel more real and memorable
- **Character Connection**: Named objects can reveal character relationships and history
- **Memorable Details**: Readers remember named objects better than generic descriptions
- **Natural Integration**: Names should feel organic, not forced—they often come from character affection or habit

**Example of named objects:**
> You climbed into the Broomstick, your trusty butter-yellow hatchback, and turned the key. The engine sputtered to life with its familiar, slightly concerning rattle—the same rattle it had had for the past three years, and which you'd learned to interpret as "I'm fine, really, just being dramatic."

> The house at the end of the driveway was called Nowhere House, which you found both ominous and oddly fitting. It wasn't on any map, and the satnav had given up trying to find it about five miles back, but there it was, large and gabled and set against an endless pale sky.

**Avoid:**
> You got into your car and drove away. (Generic, no personality)
> You arrived at the house. (No name, no character)

**Example of rich, layered description:**
> The kitchen smelled of cinnamon and vanilla, with a hint of something magical you couldn't quite name. A kettle whistled merrily on the stove—a copper kettle with a dent on one side and a handle wrapped in red-and-white striped cloth. Through the window, you could see snowflakes dancing in the golden light of streetlamps, each one catching the light like tiny, frozen stars. The worn wooden table in the center of the room was set with mismatched mugs: one with a chip on the rim that you recognized from your grandmother's collection, another painted with tiny snowflakes, and a third that seemed to change color as you looked at it. *That's definitely magical,* you thought, reaching for the snowflake mug instead.

**Example of specific, evocative details:**
> You reached out and touched the garland draped over the mantel. The pine needles were soft and fragrant, releasing their fresh scent as your fingers brushed against them—the same scent that reminded you of Christmas mornings when you were small, when your father would bring in the tree and the whole house would smell like a forest. The twinkling lights woven through the branches cast warm, shifting shadows on the wall, and you noticed that one of the ornaments was a hand-painted ceramic bird, its wings spread as if it might take flight at any moment.

**Example of layered sensory details:**
> The Christmas market stretched before you, each stall glowing with warm light. The air was filled with the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and somewhere in the distance, you could hear carolers—their voices blending in harmony, though you couldn't quite make out the words. Your boots crunched on the fresh snow as you walked, and when you reached out to touch a display of hand-knitted scarves, the wool was so soft it felt like touching a cloud. But there was something else, too—a shimmer in the air that made everything feel just a little bit more magical, like the world itself was holding its breath in anticipation.

**Example of specific objects and memories:**
> You stepped into the cottage and immediately noticed the bookshelf that took up most of one wall. It wasn't just any bookshelf—it was crammed with volumes that looked ancient, their spines cracked and their pages yellowed. One book caught your eye: *The Manipulation of Weather Patterns, a Study of the Effects of Spellwork on the Breeding Habits of Eastern Puffins.* You'd never heard of it, but something about the title made you smile. Next to it sat a wooden carving in the shape of a mermaid, its paint faded but still beautiful, and you found yourself wondering about the person who had placed it there, what story it might hold.

### Physical Descriptions That Reveal Character
- **Personality Through Appearance**: Use physical descriptions to reveal personality traits, not just appearance
- **Character Cues**: Include details that hint at character (e.g., "the scowling librarian," "a chubby, round-cheeked woman who sighed as if she knew exactly how this argument was going to go")
- **Specific Details**: Choose physical details that tell a story about the character
- **Avoid Generic Descriptions**: Don't just list height, hair color, eye color—make descriptions meaningful

**Example of physical description revealing character:**
> The woman who approached you was in her forties and never had time for anyone's nonsense. She crossed her arms and looked at you expectantly, and you found yourself straightening your posture automatically, as if her presence demanded it.
>
> Or:
>
> This came from Jamie, the scowling librarian, who was not in fact the skinny old man in the scarf and slippers. That was Ian. And the third person in the library was Lucie, the housekeeper, a chubby, round-cheeked woman in her fifties, who sighed as if she knew exactly how this argument was going to go. (She did know, and she was right.)
>
> Or:
>
> The old man who stood up from the vegetable patch was bald, Japanese, and in his seventies, dressed in jeans and a striped jumper with a gardening apron over the top, with broad shoulders slightly rounded by age and a warm smile that made it impossible not to smile back.

**Avoid:**
> The woman was tall with brown hair. (Generic, reveals nothing about character)
> The librarian had glasses and was wearing a sweater. (No personality cues)

**Avoid (general description):**
> The room had some furniture and decorations. (Too vague)
> You saw things that looked nice. (No specific details)
> The kitchen smelled good. (What does it smell like? Be specific)

## 5. Magical Elements

### Philosophy
- **Grounded and Subtle**: Magic should feel natural, not outlandish
- **Integrated into Daily Life**: Magic enhances ordinary moments rather than replacing them
- **Enhancement, Not Domination**: The story is about people and relationships; magic is the seasoning, not the main course

### What's Appropriate
- Talking animal familiars (wise, witty, or sassy companions)
- Objects with subtle magical properties (a kettle that always has hot cocoa, books that rearrange themselves)
- Gentle transformations (snow that sparkles unusually, lights that respond to mood)
- Small, practical magic that makes life more delightful

### What to Avoid
- Epic fantasy scale (no world-ending threats, no massive battles)
- Overly complex magic systems with strict rules
- Magic that solves every problem instantly
- Dark or dangerous magic that creates fear or tension

**Example of grounded magic:**
> The cat on the windowsill turned to look at you, its eyes twinkling with an intelligence that seemed far beyond ordinary. "You're late," it said, its voice like the tinkling of tiny bells. "The cocoa's getting cold."

**Avoid:**
> The wizard raised his staff and cast a spell that split the sky in two, revealing the realm of the gods beyond.

## 6. Dialogue

### Style
- **Witty**: Characters should be clever and quick with words
- **Warm**: Dialogue should feel friendly and inviting
- **Occasionally Sassy**: A bit of playful attitude adds personality
- **Natural Flow**: Conversations should feel real, not stilted or overly formal
- **Character-Driven**: Each character's speech should reflect their unique personality, quirks, and background
- **Playful Banter**: Use witty exchanges and playful back-and-forth to create engaging interactions

### Guidelines
- Each character should have a distinct voice that readers can recognize
- Dialogue should reveal character personality, quirks, and relationships
- Keep it conversational—people don't always speak in complete sentences
- Use dialogue to show relationships and create connection
- Let characters reveal themselves through what they say and how they say it
- Include personality quirks in speech patterns (anxiety, humor, formality, etc.)
- Use dialogue tags and actions to enhance character voice, not just "said"

### Making Dialogue Witter and More Character-Driven
- **Personality Quirks**: Give characters speech patterns that reflect their nature (anxious characters might ramble, confident ones might be direct)
- **Playful Banter**: Create back-and-forth exchanges that show relationships and add humor
- **Revealing Details**: Let characters reveal information about themselves through their speech
- **Natural Interruptions**: People interrupt each other, finish each other's sentences, or respond to unspoken cues
- **Subtext**: Sometimes what characters don't say is as important as what they do say
- **Dialogue Flow**: Let conversations feel natural with interruptions, pauses, and unspoken responses
- **Character Reactions**: Show how characters respond to each other through dialogue and action

**Example of witty, character-driven dialogue:**
> "Oh, you found the secret passage!" The woman's eyes crinkled with delight. "I was wondering when you'd stumble across that. Most people take at least three tries."
> 
> "You mean other people have been here?" you asked.
> 
> "Well, not *people* exactly," she said with a wink. "But close enough. The last one was a talking cat, and before that, a very determined raven. You're the first human in, oh, let's see..." She tapped her chin. "Three years? Four? Time gets a bit fuzzy when you're surrounded by magic."

**Example of sassy, personality-driven dialogue:**
> The raven on the bookshelf ruffled its feathers. "Oh, wonderful. Another one who thinks they're special. Let me guess—you're here to save Christmas?"
> 
> "I—" you started.
> 
> "No, wait, let me try again." The raven hopped to a higher perch. "You're here because you followed some twinkling lights and got lost. Am I close?"
> 
> "Actually, that's pretty accurate," you admitted.
> 
> "Of course it is. Happens every year." The raven's voice softened slightly. "But you know what? The lost ones are usually the most interesting. So, what brings you to my library?"

**Example of playful banter:**
> "You're late," the cat said, its tail twitching.
> 
> "Late for what?" you asked. *I didn't know I had an appointment with a talking cat.*
> 
> "For cocoa, obviously." The cat gestured with a paw toward a steaming mug that definitely hadn't been there a moment before. "I've been keeping it warm, but my patience—and my magic—has limits."
> 
> "I'm sorry, I didn't realize—"
> 
> "That's what they all say." The cat's eyes narrowed, but you could have sworn it was suppressing a smile. "Just drink it before it gets cold. Again."

**Example of character quirks through dialogue:**
> The spider plant rustled its leaves nervously. "We're going to die," it informed you, its voice shaking. "Absolutely, one hundred percent, we are going to die."
> 
> "The fighting won't come here," you said, trying to sound reassuring.
> 
> "The fighting is *already* here!" The plant shook so hard that several leaves detached and floated to the floor. "Gah, I'm shedding! This is exactly what I was afraid of. Stress-induced leaf loss. I read about this in *The Complete Guide to Plant Anxiety*—"
> 
> "You need to think about something else," you interrupted gently. "Oak trees are struck by lightning more often than any other tree. Apples can float because they are twenty-five percent air."
> 
> "Unless the outside is on fire," the plant said miserably. "How fast do they chirp if it's all on fire?"

**Example of natural interruptions and dialogue flow:**
> "I'm having a hard time not telling my fiancée the truth about my magic," Hilda offered. "I feel like I'm hiding so much of myself from her, and I hate it."
> 
> "You could always try *not* getting married," Primrose said, who felt it was everyone's duty to make sacrifices for the greater good. "And while you ponder that, dear," she went on as Hilda opened her mouth and then shut it again as if she'd thought better of whatever she was about to say, "Is anyone having any *actual* trouble? Any inquisitive neighbours asking too many questions? Any uncontrollable magical outbursts?"
>
> Or:
>
> "For the millionth time," you said, irked beyond belief, "I post videos online *pretending* to be a witch. It's just a performance." Primrose raised her eyebrows. You raised yours right back. "Hundreds of people do the same thing, you know. The whole witch aesthetic is very popular!"
>
> "Witchcore," Hilda said, nodding wisely. "Not quite as popular as cottagecore or fairycore, but it's up there."
>
> Everyone stared at her.
>
> "I didn't know fairies were real!" Agatha shouted, who was almost as old as Primrose and tended to believe all young people needed to be shouted at lest they miss the import of her pronouncements. "Whatever next!"

**Avoid:**
> "Hello," the character said. "How are you?" (Too formal, no personality)
> "I am here to help you," the wizard said. (Stilted, no character voice)
> All characters sounding the same (No distinct voices)

---

## 7. Sentence Variety & Rhythm

### The Power of Varied Sentence Structure
- **Mix Short and Long**: Combine short, punchy sentences with longer, flowing ones to create rhythm
- **Pacing Control**: Use sentence length to control the pace—short sentences for urgency, long ones for contemplation
- **Emotional Impact**: Vary structure to match the emotional tone of the moment
- **Reading Rhythm**: Create a natural, engaging reading experience through varied sentence patterns

### When to Use Short Sentences
- Moments of realization or surprise
- Action sequences or urgent moments
- Emphasis on a particular thought or feeling
- Creating tension or suspense
- Quick, punchy dialogue tags or reactions

### When to Use Long Sentences
- Descriptive passages that build atmosphere
- Moments of reflection or contemplation
- Layering multiple sensory details
- Creating a flowing, dreamy quality
- Building up to a revelation or important moment

### Guidelines
- Don't use all short sentences—it can feel choppy
- Don't use all long sentences—it can feel overwhelming
- Vary structure within paragraphs, not just between them
- Match sentence structure to the content and mood
- Use fragments sparingly for emphasis
- Use parenthetical asides for humor, additional context, or character voice
- Very short sentences or fragments can create dramatic emphasis when used strategically

**Example of varied sentence structure:**
> You stepped through the doorway. *This can't be right.* The room stretched far beyond what the cottage's exterior suggested, its walls lined with bookshelves that reached toward a ceiling you couldn't quite see, each shelf crammed with volumes whose spines were cracked and pages yellowed with age. The air smelled of old paper and something else, something that made your skin tingle. Magic. It had to be magic.
>
> You reached out to touch one of the books, then hesitated. *What if it's a trap?* But the books looked so inviting, their spines worn and friendly, like old friends waiting to share their secrets. *Oh, what's the worst that could happen?* You pulled one from the shelf.

**Example of short sentences for impact:**
> The door creaked open. *Here goes nothing.* You stepped inside.
>
> Or:
>
> You stared at the present. *It has my name on it. How is that possible?*

**Example of long sentences for atmosphere:**
> The Christmas market stretched before you, each stall glowing with warm light that cast dancing shadows on the fresh snow, and the air was filled with the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, with something else underneath—a hint of cinnamon and vanilla and something magical you couldn't quite name, while somewhere in the distance you could hear carolers, their voices blending in harmony though you couldn't quite make out the words, and your boots crunched on the snow as you walked, and when you reached out to touch a display of hand-knitted scarves, the wool was so soft it felt like touching a cloud.

**Example of mixing for rhythm:**
> The cat on the windowsill turned to look at you. Its eyes twinkled with an intelligence that seemed far beyond ordinary, and you found yourself wondering if you were imagining things, if maybe you'd had too much eggnog, if perhaps this whole evening was some kind of elaborate dream. "You're late," it said, its voice like the tinkling of tiny bells.
>
> *Late for what?* you wondered. *I didn't know I had an appointment with a talking cat.*
>
> "The cocoa's getting cold," the cat continued, gesturing with a paw toward a steaming mug that definitely hadn't been there a moment before, and you realized that whether this was real or a dream, you were definitely going to drink that cocoa.

**Example of parenthetical asides:**
> The woman who approached you was in her forties and never had time for anyone's nonsense. (This was something you'd learned the hard way during your first meeting, when you'd tried to explain why you were five minutes late and she'd simply raised an eyebrow and said, "I don't care.") She crossed her arms and looked at you expectantly.
>
> Or:
>
> You'd been told that Primrose was the oldest, most powerful, and most bossy witch in the group. (This might have been something of an exaggeration, but it was impossible to tell how old Primrose really was. She wouldn't say.) Still, you'd learned to take her pronouncements seriously, even when they seemed ridiculous.

**Example of very short, punchy sentences for emphasis:**
> The meeting was always on the third Thursday of every third month, but that was just about the only thing that never changed. They never met in the same place twice; the last meeting had been in someone's front room with freshly baked scones, and the one before that had been in a garden full of sunshine. *This* meeting, on a cold, wet October afternoon, happened to be taking place on a tiny, abandoned pier in the Outer Hebrides.
>
> A pier. In the Outer Hebrides. In *October*.
>
> Or:
>
> You stared at the letter in your hands. *WITCH WANTED*, it said in all capitals. You'd almost thrown it away. Almost. But something had made you keep it. Curiosity, maybe. Or maybe it was the way the paper seemed to shimmer slightly in the light. Magic. It had to be magic.

**Avoid:**
> You walked into the room. You saw a table. You saw a chair. You saw a window. (Too choppy, all short sentences)
> You walked into the room and you saw a table and you saw a chair and you saw a window and everything looked nice. (Too repetitive, no variety)
> You walked into the room that had a table and a chair and a window, and everything looked nice, and you felt happy, and you decided to sit down, and then you noticed something else. (Too long, no breaks)

## 8. Length & Structure

### Section Requirements
- **Minimum**: 50 words per section
- **Maximum**: One page of normal typesetting (approximately 250-300 words, depending on formatting)
- **Target Total**: ~100 pages for the complete book

### Structure Guidelines
- Each section should feel complete—a small scene or moment
- Leave room for choices at the end (if applicable)
- Balance description, action, and dialogue within the word limit
- End sections with a natural pause or decision point

### Pacing
- Don't rush through important moments
- Don't drag out simple actions
- Each section should advance the story meaningfully
- Vary the pace—some sections can be contemplative, others more active

---

## 9. Choice Presentation

### Evolution of Choices
- **Early Choices**: Playful and experimental—let readers explore and have fun
- **Later Choices**: More consequential as the story progresses—decisions should matter
- **Tone Matching**: Choice text should match the tone of the section
- **Meaningful Engagement**: Choices should feel important, not arbitrary

### Choice Guidelines
- Present 2-3 choices per section (when applicable)
- Make each choice distinct and appealing in its own way
- Avoid choices that are obviously "right" or "wrong"
- Choice text should be clear and enticing

**Example of playful early choice:**
> - Follow the twinkling lights deeper into the garden
> - Investigate the mysterious sound coming from the shed
> - Knock on the cottage door and see who answers

**Example of consequential later choice:**
> - Trust the stranger and follow them to the hidden workshop
> - Stay behind and search for answers on your own
> - Call out to the others for help

---

## 10. Christmas Themes

### Traditional Elements
- Decorations: twinkling lights, garlands, ornaments, wreaths
- Traditions: gift-giving, caroling, holiday baking, tree decorating
- Settings: cozy cottages, snowy streets, Christmas markets, warm kitchens
- Atmosphere: warmth, togetherness, wonder, anticipation

### Holiday Magic
- The magic of the season should feel special and meaningful
- Christmas traditions can have magical twists
- The wonder of the holidays should enhance the magical elements
- Themes of giving, connection, and joy should shine through

### Integration
- Weave Christmas elements naturally—don't force them
- Let the holiday atmosphere enhance the cozy, magical tone
- Use Christmas as a backdrop, not the entire focus
- Balance holiday-specific content with universal themes

**Example:**
> The Christmas market stretched before you, each stall glowing with warm light that cast dancing shadows on the fresh snow. The air was filled with the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and somewhere in the distance, you could hear carolers—their voices blending in harmony, though you couldn't quite make out the words. Your boots crunched on the snow as you walked, and when you reached out to touch a display of hand-knitted scarves, the wool was so soft it felt like touching a cloud. But there was something else, too—a shimmer in the air that made everything feel just a little bit more magical, like the world itself was holding its breath in anticipation.

## 11. Character Development

### Character Guidelines
- **Named Characters**: Use specific names, not generic descriptions
- **Distinct Personalities**: Each character should feel unique and memorable
- **Relatable**: Characters should feel real, with quirks and flaws that make them human
- **Driving the Story**: Character interactions and relationships should propel the narrative forward

### Character Introduction Techniques
- **Introduce with Multiple Details**: When introducing a character, combine physical description, personality traits, and relationship context all at once
- **Specific Over Generic**: Use specific details that reveal character (e.g., "who was in her forties and never had time for anyone's nonsense" rather than "who was middle-aged and practical")
- **Personality Through Description**: Let physical descriptions reveal personality traits and quirks
- **Relationship Context**: Establish relationships through shared history and current interactions
- **Natural Integration**: Weave character introductions into the narrative flow, not as separate blocks

**Example of character introduction:**
> The woman who approached you was Belinda Nkala, who was in her forties and never had time for anyone's nonsense. She crossed her arms and looked at you expectantly, and you found yourself straightening your posture automatically, as if her presence demanded it.
>
> Or:
>
> This came from Jamie, the scowling librarian, who was not in fact the skinny old man in the scarf and slippers. That was Ian. And the third person in the library was Lucie, the housekeeper, a chubby, round-cheeked woman in her fifties, who sighed as if she knew exactly how this argument was going to go. (She did know, and she was right.)

**Example of personality through physical description:**
> The old man who stood up from the vegetable patch was bald, Japanese, and in his seventies, dressed in jeans and a striped jumper with a gardening apron over the top, with broad shoulders slightly rounded by age and a warm smile that made it impossible not to smile back.

**Avoid:**
> A woman walked up to you. (Too generic, no personality)
> The librarian was there. (No distinguishing details)

### Character Relationships
- **Complex Relationships**: Show relationships that have history and complexity (e.g., "wobbly relationship," "mixed feelings")
- **Shared History**: Reference past interactions and experiences that inform current dynamics
- **Emotional Nuance**: Characters can have mixed feelings about each other—gratitude and resentment, affection and frustration
- **Relationship Through Interaction**: Show relationships through how characters speak to and respond to each other

**Example of complex relationship:**
> You'd known Primrose for as long as you could remember, and your feelings about her were, thus, mixed. She had kept you safe, for which you were grateful, but you also resented having such an inconsistent, autocratic figure in your life. While it seemed to you that you had never done anything Primrose approved of, you had not done anything Primrose especially *disapproved* of, either. At least, not until last year.

### Character Files
- Maintain detailed character information in `CHARACTERS.md`
- Reference character details when writing sections
- Keep character voices consistent across sections
- Develop characters through dialogue, actions, and interactions

### Character Voice
- Each character should have a recognizable way of speaking
- Consider their background, personality, and role in the story
- Let characters reveal themselves through what they say and do
- Avoid making all characters sound the same

### Backstory Integration
- **Natural Flow**: Weave backstory into the narrative flow, not as separate info-dumps
- **Triggered by Context**: Let backstory emerge naturally from the current scene or situation
- **Second-Person Adaptation**: Use phrases like "You remembered..." or "You'd been told..." or "According to what you'd learned..." to introduce backstory
- **Specific Details**: Include specific, concrete details from the past that feel real and lived-in
- **Emotional Connection**: Connect backstory to current emotions and reactions
- **Gradual Revelation**: Reveal backstory in pieces, not all at once

**Example of natural backstory integration:**
> The problem, really, was that witches were always orphans. According to what you'd been told, this was because of a spell that went wrong in some bygone era. You were certain this tale was a figment of someone's imagination, but you also had no better explanation because the fact remained: when a witch was born, she would find herself orphaned shortly thereafter.
>
> Or:
>
> You remembered growing up in the care of nannies and tutors of all genders, ethnicities, and temperaments, each of whom was only permitted to stay for as long as it took to catch a glimpse of something magical (which was not long) before they were replaced. So you remembered having plenty to eat, a warm bed, and all the books you could possibly read, but very little in the way of companionship or love.

**Example of backstory triggered by context:**
> You'd been told that witches were always supposed to lead separate lives. No visits, no texts, no emails—nothing that could lead anybody from one witch to another. Too much magic left unchecked in one place, you'd been warned, would draw attention. For the sake of all of you, you had to stay apart.
>
> But here you were, standing on a pier in the Outer Hebrides with twenty other witches, and you couldn't help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, the rules were more flexible than you'd been led to believe.

**Avoid:**
> You were a witch. Witches were always orphans because of a spell that went wrong. You had grown up with nannies and tutors. You had very little companionship or love. (Info-dump, not integrated)
> Once upon a time, you were born... (Too formal, breaks immersion)
