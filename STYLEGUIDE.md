# Style Guide: Christmas Adventure Story

This style guide establishes the writing standards for our cozy, magical Christmas choose-your-own-adventure story. The tone and style are inspired by "The Spellshop" by Sarah Beth Durst and "The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches" by Sangu Mandanna.

## 1. Tone & Voice

### Core Principles
- **Cozy and Magical**: The story should feel warm, inviting, and infused with wonder
- **Light-hearted and Fun**: Maintain a playful, joyful atmosphere throughout
- **Warm and Inviting**: Readers should feel welcomed into the story world
- **Balanced Humor**: Blend whimsical elements with light, gentle humor—never mean-spirited or cynical

### Voice Characteristics
- Conversational and approachable
- Enthusiastic but not overwhelming
- Comforting, like a warm cup of cocoa on a cold night
- Wonder-filled without being saccharine

**Example of good tone:**
> The snowflakes drifted down like tiny, frozen stars, each one catching the light from the windows of the cottage ahead. You could almost hear them whispering secrets as they landed on your coat.

**Avoid:**
> The snow fell heavily, obscuring your vision and making the path treacherous.

---

## 2. Point of View & Tense

### Perspective
- **Second Person ("You")**: The story directly addresses the reader as the protagonist
- **Past Tense**: All narrative should be written in past tense
- **Direct Address**: Use "you" to create an immersive, interactive experience

### Guidelines
- Use "you" consistently throughout sections
- Avoid switching to third person or first person
- Keep the reader as the active participant in the story

**Example:**
> You stepped through the doorway and found yourself in a room that seemed to stretch far beyond what the cottage's exterior suggested. The walls were lined with bookshelves that reached toward a ceiling you couldn't quite see.

**Avoid:**
> The character stepped through the doorway... (third person)
> I stepped through the doorway... (first person)

## 3. Description & Atmosphere

### Approach
- **Rich and Immersive**: Paint vivid pictures that engage all the senses
- **Sensory Details**: Include sights, sounds, smells, textures, and even tastes where appropriate
- **Lived-in Feel**: Settings should feel real and inhabited, not sterile or empty
- **Christmas Integration**: Weave traditional Christmas elements naturally throughout

### Description Guidelines
- Show, don't tell—let readers experience the world through details
- Use specific, evocative language rather than generic terms
- Balance description with action—don't let it slow the pace too much
- Create atmosphere through careful word choice

**Example of rich description:**
> The kitchen smelled of cinnamon and vanilla, with a hint of something magical you couldn't quite name. A kettle whistled merrily on the stove, and through the window, you could see snowflakes dancing in the golden light of streetlamps. The worn wooden table in the center of the room was set with mismatched mugs, each one unique and charming in its own way.

**Example of sensory details:**
> You reached out and touched the garland draped over the mantel. The pine needles were soft and fragrant, releasing their fresh scent as your fingers brushed against them. The twinkling lights woven through the branches cast warm, shifting shadows on the wall.

## 4. Magical Elements

### Philosophy
- **Grounded and Subtle**: Magic should feel natural, not outlandish
- **Integrated into Daily Life**: Magic enhances ordinary moments rather than replacing them
- **Enhancement, Not Domination**: The story is about people and relationships; magic is the seasoning, not the main course

### What's Appropriate
- Talking animal familiars (wise, witty, or sassy companions)
- Objects with subtle magical properties (a kettle that always has hot cocoa, books that rearrange themselves)
- Gentle transformations (snow that sparkles unusually, lights that respond to mood)
- Small, practical magic that makes life more delightful

### What to Avoid
- Epic fantasy scale (no world-ending threats, no massive battles)
- Overly complex magic systems with strict rules
- Magic that solves every problem instantly
- Dark or dangerous magic that creates fear or tension

**Example of grounded magic:**
> The cat on the windowsill turned to look at you, its eyes twinkling with an intelligence that seemed far beyond ordinary. "You're late," it said, its voice like the tinkling of tiny bells. "The cocoa's getting cold."

**Avoid:**
> The wizard raised his staff and cast a spell that split the sky in two, revealing the realm of the gods beyond.

## 5. Dialogue

### Style
- **Witty**: Characters should be clever and quick with words
- **Warm**: Dialogue should feel friendly and inviting
- **Occasionally Sassy**: A bit of playful attitude adds personality
- **Natural Flow**: Conversations should feel real, not stilted or overly formal

### Guidelines
- Each character should have a distinct voice
- Dialogue should reveal character personality and advance the plot
- Keep it conversational—people don't always speak in complete sentences
- Use dialogue to show relationships and create connection

**Example of good dialogue:**
> "Oh, you found the secret passage!" The woman's eyes crinkled with delight. "I was wondering when you'd stumble across that. Most people take at least three tries."
> 
> "You mean other people have been here?" you asked.
> 
> "Well, not *people* exactly," she said with a wink. "But close enough."

**Example of sassy dialogue:**
> The raven on the bookshelf ruffled its feathers. "Oh, wonderful. Another one who thinks they're special. Let me guess—you're here to save Christmas?"

## 6. Length & Structure

### Section Requirements
- **Minimum**: 50 words per section
- **Maximum**: One page of normal typesetting (approximately 250-300 words, depending on formatting)
- **Target Total**: ~100 pages for the complete book

### Structure Guidelines
- Each section should feel complete—a small scene or moment
- Leave room for choices at the end (if applicable)
- Balance description, action, and dialogue within the word limit
- End sections with a natural pause or decision point

### Pacing
- Don't rush through important moments
- Don't drag out simple actions
- Each section should advance the story meaningfully
- Vary the pace—some sections can be contemplative, others more active

---

## 7. Choice Presentation

### Evolution of Choices
- **Early Choices**: Playful and experimental—let readers explore and have fun
- **Later Choices**: More consequential as the story progresses—decisions should matter
- **Tone Matching**: Choice text should match the tone of the section
- **Meaningful Engagement**: Choices should feel important, not arbitrary

### Choice Guidelines
- Present 2-3 choices per section (when applicable)
- Make each choice distinct and appealing in its own way
- Avoid choices that are obviously "right" or "wrong"
- Choice text should be clear and enticing

**Example of playful early choice:**
> - Follow the twinkling lights deeper into the garden
> - Investigate the mysterious sound coming from the shed
> - Knock on the cottage door and see who answers

**Example of consequential later choice:**
> - Trust the stranger and follow them to the hidden workshop
> - Stay behind and search for answers on your own
> - Call out to the others for help

## 8. Christmas Themes

### Traditional Elements
- Decorations: twinkling lights, garlands, ornaments, wreaths
- Traditions: gift-giving, caroling, holiday baking, tree decorating
- Settings: cozy cottages, snowy streets, Christmas markets, warm kitchens

### Holiday Magic
- The magic of the season should feel special and meaningful

### Integration
- Weave Christmas elements naturally—don't force them
- Let the holiday atmosphere enhance the cozy, magical tone
- Use Christmas as a backdrop, not the entire focus
- Balance holiday-specific content with universal themes

**Example:**
> The Christmas market stretched before you, each stall glowing with warm light. The air was filled with the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and somewhere in the distance, you could hear carolers. But there was something else, too—a shimmer in the air that made everything feel just a little bit more magical.
