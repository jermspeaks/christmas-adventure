They'd locked the magic away not out of malice, but out of pain. They'd seen Christmas fail, seen people disappointed, and they'd decided that the solution was to prevent anyone from ever feeling that disappointment again. But in doing so, they'd locked away their own memories, their own joy.\n\n\"Kvothe,\" you said gently, \"what was your favorite Christmas memory? Before all of this. Before you became the guardian.\"\n\nKvothe was silent for a long moment, their hand still hovering over the archway. Then, slowly, they began to speak. \"I had a family once,\" they said, their voice soft, almost lost. \"A long time ago. We used to decorate the tree together, my mother and father and I. My father would lift me up so I could place the star on top, and my mother would sing carols while we worked. The whole house would smell like gingerbread and pine, and I thought... I thought it would last forever.\"\n\nTheir voice broke, and you saw tears in their eyes—real tears, not the cold emptiness from before. \"But it didn't. My parents grew older. The magic started to fade. And one year, the tree didn't light up the way it used to. The cookies didn't taste quite as magical. And I thought... I thought it was my fault. That I'd done something wrong, that I'd broken Christmas somehow.\"\n\n*Oh,* you thought. *They blamed themselves. They thought they'd broken the magic, so they tried to protect everyone else from experiencing that same disappointment.*\n\n\"You didn't break anything,\" you said, your voice gentle but firm. \"The magic was fading because it was being locked away, not because of anything you did. And even if the magic fades sometimes, that doesn't mean Christmas is broken. Christmas isn't about perfect magic—it's about connection. It's about the people you love, the memories you make, the joy you find even when things aren't perfect.\"\n\nKvothe looked at you, and you saw something shift in their expression. The coldness began to melt away, replaced by something warm and fragile. \"I remember,\" they whispered. \"I remember the warmth. The laughter. The way my mother's voice sounded when she sang. I remember...

Alive.\n\n\"I remember,\" Kvothe said again, their voice stronger now. \"I remember what Christmas really means. And I want to share it. I want the magic to flow back, not just for me, but for everyone.\"\n\nThe magic poured out of the vault, but this time, it carried Kvothe's memories with it, infusing the world with not just magic, but with the understanding that Christmas was about connection, about love, about finding joy even when things weren't perfect.\n\n*This is different,* you realized. *This isn't just restoring the magic.
