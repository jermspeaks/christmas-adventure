The further you got from the village, the more the landscape changed. The snow became heavier, the trees taller and more imposing.

Colder, yes, but also emptier, as if something essential had been removed.\n\n\"The Frostwood Forest,\" Cheshire said quietly, their voice barely above a whisper. \"We're getting close.

Even the Keepsake Keeper in your hands seemed to dim slightly, its light struggling against the emptiness.\n\nIn the distance, you could see the edge of the forest—tall, dark trees with branches heavy with snow that didn't sparkle at all.

Cozy cottages with thatched roofs, each one decorated with garlands and wreaths that should have been glowing but instead looked… tired. The windows flickered with warm light, but it was inconsistent, like candles struggling against a breeze.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the center of the village stood a magnificent Christmas tree, taller than any of the cottages, but even from this distance, you could see that its ornaments were dim, their usual sparkle muted. A few villagers moved about, their movements slow, their expressions worried.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“There’s something else,” Cheshire said, pausing at the edge of the village. “We’ve heard whispers about a place called the Memory Vault—a hidden location where all the stolen magic might be stored. But no one knows exactly where it is, or how to get there. That’s where you come in. You might be able to find it in ways we can’t.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They looked at you expectantly. “So, where would you like to start?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you do?\u003C/p>",{"headings":6256,"localImagePaths":6259,"remoteImagePaths":6260,"frontmatter":6261,"imagePaths":6267},[6257],{"depth":24,"slug":6258,"text":6240},"first-steps",[],[],{"id":6237,"title":6240,"choices":6262},[6263,6264,6265,6266],{"text":6243,"target":5042},{"text":6245,"target":4148},{"text":6247,"target":4971},{"text":6249,"target":5032},[],"section-82",{"id":6268,"data":6270,"body":6275,"filePath":6276,"digest":6277,"rendered":6278,"legacyId":4985},{"id":6268,"title":6271,"choices":6272},"Pushing Too Hard",[6273],{"text":6274,"target":31},"Continue to the resolution","# Pushing Too Hard\n\n\"You need to tell the truth,\" you said, leaning forward. \"I know what happened.
