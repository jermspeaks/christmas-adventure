The further you got from the village, the more the landscape changed. The snow became heavier, the trees taller and more imposing. The sky, which had been a soft twilight purple, grew darker, the stars dimmer. And the air—the air felt different. Colder, yes, but also emptier, as if something essential had been removed.\n\n\"The Frostwood Forest,\" Cheshire said quietly, their voice barely above a whisper. \"We're getting close. Can you feel it? The magic is thinner here. Like someone's been draining it away.\"\n\nYou could feel it. The world around you felt less alive, less magical. Even the Keepsake Keeper in your hands seemed to dim slightly, its light struggling against the emptiness.\n\nIn the distance, you could see the edge of the forest—tall, dark trees with branches heavy with snow that didn't sparkle at all.

Elara talked about her bakery, about how it had been in her family for generations, about the Christmas cookies they’d always made, the decorations they’d always hung. “The magic loves the bakery,” she said. “It’s always been there, always been part of Christmas.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But then Maya’s mother spoke up. “We moved here three years ago,” she said. “Our old house had Christmas magic, but this new house… it doesn’t.

It’s like it doesn’t recognize our home.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>That’s it,\u003C/em> you realized. \u003Cem>The magic recognizes places with Christmas memories, but it doesn’t recognize new places, places without those memories.

The first step is to investigate where the magic is being taken from.

The path itself was magical—literally. It glowed faintly beneath your feet, a soft golden light that made the snow sparkle just a little bit more where you stepped.\n\n*Okay, that's pretty cool,* you thought, watching your footprints light up behind you.\n\n\"The village is called Starlight Hollow,\" Cheshire explained as you walked. \"It's one of the places where Christmas magic is strongest—or at least, it used to be.

Cozy cottages with thatched roofs, each one decorated with garlands and wreaths that should have been glowing but instead looked... tired. The windows flickered with warm light, but it was inconsistent, like candles struggling against a breeze.\n\nIn the center of the village stood a magnificent Christmas tree, taller than any of the cottages, but even from this distance, you could see that its ornaments were dim, their usual sparkle muted. A few villagers moved about, their movements slow, their expressions worried.\n\n\"There's something else,\" Cheshire said, pausing at the edge of the village. \"We've heard whispers about a place called the Memory Vault—a hidden location where all the stolen magic might be stored. But no one knows exactly where it is, or how to get there. That's where you come in.
