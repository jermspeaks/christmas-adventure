# Investigating if There Was Tension Between Velma and Eleanor

You decided to investigate if there was tension between Velma and Eleanor, thinking that might reveal something about their relationship.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You went through Eleanor's journal and files, looking for any mention of Velma or any conflicts between them. You found a few entries:

*December 10th: Velma asked about The Great Gatsby again. I wish she'd understand that some things aren't for sale.*
*December 15th: Velma seemed upset when I refused. But it's my collection. I have the right to decide what to sell.*

*So there was some tension,* you thought. *But it seems minor. Just a disagreement about a book. Not enough to lead to murder.*

You also thought about the physical evidence. The silver button from Marcus's cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk. *That points to Marcus, not Velma,* you thought.

*So Velma probably didn't do it,* you thought. *The evidence points to Marcus.*

You needed to focus on Marcus, and gather more evidence against him.

What do you do?
