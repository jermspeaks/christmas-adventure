# True Mastery

You realized there was more to learn, and you decided to go deeper. You began to truly connect, to truly understand, to truly master the transformed magic. It was harder, took longer, but it was real. It was true mastery, not surface learning.

*I need to go deeper,* you thought. *I need to truly connect, to truly understand, to truly master it.*

You began working on true mastery, going deeper, truly connecting, truly understanding. The magic began to respond more fully, more deeply, more meaningfully.

*This is the right way,* you thought. *This is how it should be done.*

What do you do?
