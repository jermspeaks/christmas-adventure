# Pressing Marcus Until He Breaks

You decided to keep questioning Marcus, pressing him harder and harder until he broke and told you the truth.

Yuzu stayed close, watching Marcus carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

You pressed him on every inconsistency, every lie, every detail that didn't add up. "You said you were working in the rare books section, but there's no evidence. You said you weren't in the office, but we found your button there. You said you didn't kill Eleanor, but all the evidence points to you."

Marcus's face was pale, his hands shaking. "I... I don't know what to say. I'm telling you the truth."

*But you're not,* you thought. *I can see it in your face. You're lying.*

"You're lying," you said. "And I can prove it. The button proves you were in the office. The letter from Alistair proves you were stealing books. Eleanor's journal proves she was going to confront you. It all points to you."

Marcus was silent for a long moment. Then he said, "I... I didn't mean to kill her. It was an accident. We argued, and I panicked, and I grabbed the letter opener, and... I didn't mean to do it. It just happened."

*So he's confessing,* you thought. *Finally.*

"You need to tell the police," you said. "You need to confess properly."

Marcus looked at you, his eyes full of fear and regret. "I know," he said. "I know I do. But I'm scared. What's going to happen to me?"

*That's not your problem to solve,* you thought. *You've found the truth. Now justice needs to be served.*

You looked at Yuzu, who was watching Marcus with those bright, intelligent eyes. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows we found the truth.*

What do you do?
