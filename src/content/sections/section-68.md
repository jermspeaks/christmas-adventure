# Looking for Connections Between Marcus and Alistair

You decided to investigate if there were any connections between Marcus and Alistair, thinking they might have been working together.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You thought about what you knew. Marcus had been stealing rare books from Eleanor's collection. Alistair was a rare book dealer who wanted to buy the collection. *Could Marcus have been selling the stolen books to Alistair?* you wondered.

You asked Officer Martinez about it, and she confirmed your suspicion. "We found records of sales between Marcus and Alistair," she said. "Marcus was selling books from Eleanor's collection to Alistair, and Alistair was buying them, knowing they were stolen."

*So they were working together,* you thought. *Marcus was stealing books, and Alistair was buying them.*

"But then why would Alistair write that letter to Eleanor?" you asked. "The one saying he could prove Marcus was stealing? Why would he expose his own partner?"

Officer Martinez shook her head. "We're not sure. Maybe they had a falling out. Maybe Alistair decided to turn on Marcus. Or maybe the letter was fake, written by someone else to frame Alistair."

*Or maybe Marcus wrote it,* you thought. *Maybe Marcus found out that Alistair was going to expose him, so he wrote a fake threatening note to make it look like Alistair was the bad guy, and then killed Eleanor before she could find out the truth.*

You needed to investigate their connection more carefully. You needed to find out if they were really working together, or if something else was going on.

What do you do?
