# Balancing Support

You stayed with Kvothe, supporting their transformation, but you also checked on the world, addressing problems as they arose. *I can do both,* you thought. *I can support Kvothe and help the world. I just need to find balance.*

You worked with Kvothe, helping them process, supporting their transformation. But you also kept an eye on the world, checking on problems, addressing issues, helping where needed. And as you did, you found a rhythm—time with Kvothe, time helping the world, time finding balance.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as Kvothe continued to transform, as the world's problems were addressed, as balance was found. *By doing both, by finding balance, I'm helping Kvothe and helping the world.*

Cheshire trotted between you and the world, helping where needed, their presence supportive. "You're finding balance," they said. "You're supporting Kvothe and helping the world. That's what you need to do—not choose one or the other, but find balance, do both."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Balance is important," it said. "When you support Kvothe and help the world, when you find balance between the two, you can do both effectively. That's what you're doing now."

You looked at Kvothe, at their transformation, at their need for support. But you also looked at the world, at the problems that needed addressing, at the help that was needed. *This is working,* you thought. *By finding balance, by doing both, I'm helping Kvothe and helping the world.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some days, Kvothe needed more support, and the world had to wait. Other days, the world needed more help, and Kvothe had to wait. Finding balance wasn't always easy.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some days are harder than others. How do we maintain balance?*

What do you do?
