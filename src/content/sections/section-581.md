# One Memory at a Time

You took a deep breath and moved closer to Kvothe, but this time, you moved slowly. Carefully. *One memory at a time,* you reminded yourself. *That's what they need.*

"Kvothe," you said, your voice gentle. "Let's start with just one. One good memory. Can you find one? Just one?"

Kvothe's eyes were still wide with overwhelm, but they closed, and you watched as they searched through the flood of memories, as they tried to find just one to hold onto. The chaos around them began to slow, the swirling images settling, like snowflakes finding their way to the ground.

Slowly, a smile began to form on their face. "I remember my mother singing," they said, their voice quiet but steady. "She had the most beautiful voice. She would sing carols while we decorated the tree, and I would try to sing along, even though I didn't know all the words."

As they spoke, that one memory came into focus—clear, warm, real. You could see it, feel it, the way the magic responded to it, flowing gently, steadily, like a stream finding its path.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as Kvothe's breathing steadied, as the panic in their eyes began to fade. *One memory at a time. That's what they needed.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Memories are meant to be held gently," it said. "Not all at once, but one at a time. Like ornaments on a tree—each one beautiful on its own, but together, they create something magical."

You sat with Kvothe as they held that one memory, as they processed it, as they let it settle. And you could see the transformation beginning—not rushed, not forced, but natural. Steady. Real.

*This is how it should be,* you realized. *Patient. Gentle. One step at a time.*
