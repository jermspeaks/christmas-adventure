# Trying to Get Marcus to Confess

You decided to try a different approach. Instead of accusing Marcus directly, you'd show him the button and see how he reacted. *If he's guilty,* you thought, *he'll give himself away.*

Yuzu stayed close, watching Marcus carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

You pulled out the silver button, holding it carefully. "Do you recognize this?" you asked.

Marcus's face went pale. "I... I don't know. Where did you find it?"

"Near Eleanor's desk," you said. "It looks like it came from a cardigan. A dark gray cardigan with silver buttons. Like the one you're wearing."

Marcus's hand went to his cardigan, to where one of the buttons was missing. "I... I don't know how that got there," he said. "I wasn't in the office. I was here, working."

*But you weren't working here,* you thought. *There's no evidence of that.*

"You're missing a button," you said. "And this button matches your cardigan. How do you explain that?"

Marcus was silent for a long moment. Then he said, "I... I don't know. Maybe it fell off earlier. Maybe I was in the office earlier, and it fell off then. I don't remember."

*But that doesn't make sense,* you thought. *If you were in the office earlier, why didn't you mention it? Why did you say you were in the rare books section the whole time?*

"You're lying," you said. "You were in the office. You were there when Eleanor was killed. And this button proves it."

Marcus's face tightened. "I didn't kill her," he said. "I didn't."

*But the evidence says otherwise,* you thought.

What do you do?
