# Power Over Others

You decided to use your knowledge to gain power over others, to control them, to be in charge. You thought knowledge was power, that you should use it to control. You tried to gain power.

*Knowledge is power,* you thought. *I should use it.*

But using knowledge for power only made people resist, rebel, reject you. The magic rejected you too, cutting you off. You lost everything.

*They're resisting,* you thought. *The magic is rejecting me.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light died. "You used knowledge for power," it said, its voice fading. "But knowledge is meant to be shared, taught, connected. You used it for power, and everyone rejected you, the magic rejected you. You lost everything."

*I used it for power,* you realized. *I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but you remain alone—rejected by everyone, rejected by magic, a reminder that knowledge is meant to be shared, that teaching is more important than power.
