# Rushed In

You rushed into the clearing without caution, without preparation, without thinking. You thought you could handle whatever you found, that caution wasn't necessary.

*I don't need to be careful,* you thought. *I can handle this.*

But the clearing was dangerous, especially the Memory Vault. Without caution, you quickly found yourself in trouble. You triggered something, you made a mistake, you put yourself in danger.

*This is worse than I thought,* you realized, but it was too late.

The Memory Vault reacted to your recklessness, and something went wrong. The magic became unstable, dangerous. You couldn't control it, couldn't help. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever.

*I should have been more careful,* you thought. *I should have taken my time, been more cautious.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that caution is essential, that rushing leads to mistakes, that thinking before acting is important.
