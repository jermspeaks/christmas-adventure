# Comparing the Button to Marcus's Cardigan

You decided to compare the button to Marcus's cardigan directly, thinking that would prove whether it came from his clothing.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood the importance of what you were doing.

You found Marcus in the rare books section, and you examined his cardigan carefully. Dark gray, silver buttons. And sure enough, one of the buttons was missing. The thread was visible, exactly where a button should have been.

You pulled out the silver button you'd found, and you compared it to the remaining buttons on Marcus's cardigan. They matched perfectly. Same size, same style, same silver color, same decorative pattern.

*It's definitely from his cardigan,* you thought. *There's no doubt about it.*

"Marcus," you said, holding up the button. "This button matches your cardigan. And you're missing a button. How do you explain that?"

Marcus's face went white. "I... I don't know. Maybe it fell off earlier. I don't remember when."

*But we found it near Eleanor's desk,* you thought. *Caught in the rug. Which means you were definitely in the office. And if you were in the office when Eleanor was killed, then you're the killer.*

"You were in the office," you said. "This button proves it. You were there when Eleanor was killed."

Marcus's face tightened. "I didn't kill her," he said. "I didn't."

*But the evidence says otherwise,* you thought. *The button proves you were there. And you have motive, and you don't have an alibi. It all points to you.*

You needed to confront him with all the evidence, or get Officer Martinez to verify it properly.

What do you do?
