# Broken Trust

You decided to break trust by forcing your way, to make people do what you wanted, to not accept no. You thought you knew what was best, that you could force them. You broke the trust.

*I know what's best,* you thought. *I can force them.*

But breaking trust only made people resist completely, reject you, cut you off. The magic lost its connection power, and everything fell apart.

*They're rejecting me,* you thought. *The magic is losing power.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You broke trust," it said, its voice sad. "But magic requires trust, connection, togetherness. You broke it, and people rejected you, the magic lost its connection power. Everything fell apart."

*I broke the trust,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the community remains broken—trust lost, magic weakened, a reminder that trust is essential, that connection is more important than forcing.
