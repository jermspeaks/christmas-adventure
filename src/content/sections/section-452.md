# Incomplete Knowledge

You thought the Keepsake Keeper had told you everything, confident that you had all the information you needed. You knew where the vault was, you knew how to get there, you knew what to do.

*I have everything I need,* you thought. *The Keepsake Keeper told me everything.*

But as you approached the Memory Vault, you began to realize something was missing. The Keepsake Keeper had mentioned something important, but you couldn't remember what. There was a detail, a warning, a piece of information that you'd missed, that you'd forgotten, that you'd dismissed.

*What did I miss?* you thought, but you weren't sure.

The Keepsake Keeper's light flickered, and you heard its voice, worried. "I didn't tell you everything," it said. "There's something important I didn't mention. Something you need to know before you try to open the vault."

*What is it?* you wondered. *What didn't you tell me?*

What do you do?
