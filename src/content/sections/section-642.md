# Waiting Too Long

You stayed back, watching, waiting, hoping people would figure it out on their own. *Maybe they just need more time,* you thought. *Maybe they'll understand if I give them space.*

But as more time passed, the problems only grew. Frustration turned to anger. Confusion turned to despair. People were giving up, convinced the magic was broken, that it would never work for them.

*This isn't working,* you realized, watching as hope faded, as people gave up. *They're not figuring it out. They need help, and I'm not giving it to them.*

You saw Elara throw her hands up in frustration, walking away from the magic, giving up. "It's not working," she said to a neighbor. "I don't understand. I've tried everything, and nothing works. The magic is broken. It's not for me."

*They're giving up,* you thought, a cold feeling settling in your stomach. *They're giving up because I waited too long, because I didn't help them when they needed it.*

Cheshire trotted over to you, their eyes worried. "The problems are getting worse," they said. "People are giving up. They needed help, guidance, someone to show them the way. But you waited, and now the frustration has grown, and it's harder to help them."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed urgently. "Waiting too long can make problems worse," it said. "When people struggle without help, frustration grows, hope fades, and they give up. By waiting, you've made it harder to help them. They needed intervention earlier, when the problems were smaller, when hope was still there."

*I made a mistake,* you realized. *I waited too long. I should have helped them earlier, when the problems were smaller, when they still had hope. Now it's harder, but maybe I can still help. Maybe it's not too late.*

You looked at the people who had given up, at the ones who were still struggling, at the frustration and despair that had grown. *I need to intervene now,* you thought. *I need to help them, to guide them, to show them the way. Even if it's harder now, I have to try.*

What do you do?
