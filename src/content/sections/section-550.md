# Seeking Kvothe's Help

You looked at the chaos around you—the flickering lights, the unstable magic, the worried faces of the townspeople—and you made a decision. *I need help,* you thought. *I need someone who understands magic better than I do. I need Kvothe.*

"Stay here," you told Cheshire. "I'm going to find Kvothe. They understand magic better than anyone. If anyone can help us figure out what's happening, it's them."

Cheshire nodded, their expression worried. "Be careful," they said. "The magic is unstable everywhere. Even the path to the vault might be affected."

You set off, the Keepsake Keeper warm in your hands, its light pulsing steadily as you made your way out of Starlight Hollow and toward the Frostwood Forest. The path felt different now—the magic was everywhere, but it was chaotic, unpredictable. Trees that should have been sparkling were flickering. Snow that should have been steady was shifting, melting and refreezing in strange patterns.

*The magic is trying to restore itself,* you thought, *but it doesn't know how. It's like it's remembering the old world, but the world has changed.*

As you approached the clearing where the Memory Vault had been, you saw Kvothe sitting at the edge, their back to where the vault once stood, staring out at the forest. They looked different now—human, warm, alive—but there was something thoughtful in their posture, something contemplative.

*They're processing everything,* you realized. *The transformation, the magic returning, the changes. They're trying to understand their new role in this restored world.*

You approached slowly, and Kvothe looked up at you, their expression shifting from contemplation to concern. "You're back," they said. "And you look worried. What's happening?"

"The magic is back," you said, "but it's not stable. Starlight Hollow is in chaos—some places have too much magic, others have too little. Lights are flickering, things are floating, trees are growing or shrinking. The magic doesn't know how much to give, or where to go."

Kvothe's expression darkened with understanding. "The world has changed since the magic was locked away," they said. "Places that remember Christmas traditions are pulling in too much magic. Places that have forgotten are getting nothing. The magic is trying to restore itself, but it's remembering the old world, not understanding the new one."

*They understand,* you thought. *They know what's happening. They can help.*

What do you do?
