# Selfish Desire

You tried to take the magic for yourself, thinking you deserved it, that you should have it, that it was yours to claim. You reached for the magic, trying to hoard it, to keep it, to control it.

*I deserve this,* you thought. *This magic should be mine.*

But the magic wasn't meant to be hoarded. It was meant to be shared, to flow freely, to bring joy to everyone. When you tried to take it for yourself, the magic rejected you. It pulled away, it resisted, it refused to respond.

*It's not working,* you realized, but it was too late.

The magic rejected you completely, cutting you off, locking you out. You couldn't access it, couldn't use it, couldn't help. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever.

*I should have shared it,* you thought. *I should have let it flow, not tried to hoard it.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that magic is meant to be shared, that hoarding is wrong, that giving is more important than taking.
