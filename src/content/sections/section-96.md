# Looking for Evidence That Contradicts Marcus's Story

You decided to look for evidence that contradicted Marcus's story, thinking that would help you prove he was lying.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You went back to the rare books section, looking for any evidence that Marcus had actually been working there. But there was nothing. No catalog, no notes, no signs of recent work. Everything was pristine, organized, as if it had been that way for a while.

*So he wasn't working here,* you thought. *His alibi doesn't hold up.*

You also checked the timeline. Marcus said he'd been working in the rare books section all afternoon, but if he'd been working on a new acquisition, there should have been evidence of that. But there wasn't.

*So he's lying about where he was,* you thought. *And if he's lying about where he was, then where was he really?*

You also thought about the silver button. It was found near Eleanor's desk, caught in the rug. *If that button came from Marcus's cardigan, and it was found at the scene, then Marcus was definitely in the office,* you thought.

*So Marcus was in the office,* you thought. *He was there when Eleanor was killed. And he's lying about it.*

You needed to confront him with all this evidence, and get him to tell the truth.

What do you do?
