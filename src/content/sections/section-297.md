# Addressing the Issues

You noticed that underlying issues were being ignored, and you decided to address them. You began to deal with the problems, to fix the issues, to truly resolve things. It was harder, took longer, but it was real. It was a true solution, not a false one.

*I need to address them,* you thought. *I need to deal with the problems, to fix the issues, to truly resolve things.*

You began working on addressing the issues, dealing with problems, fixing issues, truly resolving things. The celebration continued, but it was real, built on true solutions, not false ones.

*This is the right way,* you thought. *This is how it should be done.*

What do you do?
