# Determining Time of Death

You focused on trying to figure out exactly when Eleanor had been killed. *If I can determine the time of death,* you thought, *I can figure out who had the opportunity.*

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood the importance of what you were doing.

You thought about the evidence. Eleanor's tea was still warm. You'd touched it earlier, and it had been warm to the touch. *How long does tea stay warm?* you wondered. *Maybe an hour? Maybe two?*

*If the tea is still warm, and it's 4:30 PM now, then Eleanor was probably killed within the last hour or two,* you thought. *Maybe around 3:00 PM or 4:00 PM.*

You looked at Eleanor's calendar again. "4:00 PM - Important meeting." *Was that when she was killed? Was that when she was supposed to meet someone?*

You also thought about the position of the body. Eleanor was lying on the floor behind her desk, as if she'd been sitting at her desk when she was attacked. The letter opener was on the floor near the door, as if someone had dropped it while leaving.

*So someone came into the office, argued with Eleanor, grabbed the letter opener, killed her, and then left,* you thought. *And they dropped the letter opener on the way out.*

You thought about the torn note. "...before Christmas Eve or else..." *Was that a threat? Was someone threatening Eleanor?*

You needed more information. You needed to know exactly when Eleanor had been killed. You needed to check if there were any other clues about timing—maybe security footage, maybe witnesses, maybe something else.

What do you do?
