# A Bridge Between

You looked at Cheshire, their autumn-colored fur catching the light, their eyes full of understanding. *Maybe they can reach Kvothe in a way I can't,* you thought. *Sometimes help comes through others.*

"Cheshire," you said, "can you... can you check on them? I think they might respond better to you right now."

Cheshire's eyes softened, and they nodded. "Sometimes people need a bridge," they said, their voice gentle. "Someone to help them remember they're not alone, that they can trust, that they can reach out. I can be that bridge."

They trotted toward Kvothe, their movements graceful and unhurried. As they approached, you saw something shift—the emptiness around Kvothe didn't deepen, didn't push Cheshire away. Instead, it seemed to... pause. To listen.

Cheshire settled down beside Kvothe, not speaking, just being there. And slowly, you saw Kvothe's shoulders relax. Their hands unclenched. The shadows that had been creeping back began to recede.

*They're responding to Cheshire,* you realized, watching as a memory flickered—just a small one, but it was there. A warm presence. A gentle touch. The feeling of not being alone.

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly. "Sometimes the best help is indirect," it said. "Sometimes people need someone else to remind them of connection, of trust, of the fact that they don't have to do this alone."

You watched as Cheshire and Kvothe sat together, and you felt something warm in your chest—not jealousy, but gratitude. *Sometimes help comes through others,* you thought. *And that's okay. That's still help.*
