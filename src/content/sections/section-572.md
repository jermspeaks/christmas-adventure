# Waiting Too Long

You stayed where you were, watching, waiting. *Maybe they just need more time,* you thought. *Maybe if I wait, they'll come to me when they're ready.*

But the minutes stretched into what felt like hours, and Kvothe didn't move. They didn't look up. They didn't come to you. Instead, you watched as the emptiness around them deepened, as the shadows that had once cloaked them began to creep back, slowly, like ink spreading through water.

*They're not coming,* you realized, your heart sinking. *They're sinking deeper. I waited too long.*

The memories that had been flickering around them earlier had completely faded now, replaced by that same cold emptiness you'd seen when you first met them. The transformation was reversing, undoing itself, and you were just watching it happen.

Cheshire trotted over to you, their eyes urgent. "They're not going to come to you," they said. "They're too lost. They need you to go to them. Waiting isn't helping—it's making it worse."

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its worry. "Sometimes people need space," it said. "But sometimes they need someone to reach out, to remind them they're not alone. If you wait too long, they might forget how to reach back."

*I should have gone to them sooner,* you thought, watching as Kvothe's form began to fade, as the shadows reclaimed them. *I thought I was being respectful, giving them space, but I was just letting them disappear.*

You stood up, your decision made. *It's not too late. I can still help. I just need to reach out now, before it's too late.*
