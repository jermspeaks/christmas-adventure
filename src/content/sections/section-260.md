# Kvothe's Suppression

Kvothe seemed fine. They were adjusting, learning, growing. They seemed happy, content, at peace. Everything seemed... perfect. Fixed. Resolved.

*They're fine,* you thought, relief flooding through you. *Kvothe is adjusting. Everything is working.*

But as time passed, you began to notice something. Kvothe wasn't really fine—they were suppressing their true self. They weren't adjusting—they were hiding, pretending, putting on a mask. The peace was an illusion, a temporary fix that was hiding the real problem.

*Something's not right,* you thought, but you weren't sure what. *Kvothe seems... too perfect. Too calm. Like they're trying too hard.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly, and you could feel its concern. "Kvothe is suppressing," it said, its voice worried. "They're not truly adjusting—they're hiding their true self. This is not a solution. This is a delay. Eventually, they will break, and when they do, it will be worse than before."

*Oh no,* you realized. *Kvothe isn't fine. They're suppressing. And when they break, it will be worse.*

What do you do?
