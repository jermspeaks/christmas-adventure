# The Wrong Conclusion

You stuck to your theory. Velma Ousley had killed Eleanor. You were certain of it.

But as the days passed, and the police investigation continued, it became clear that you were wrong. Velma had nothing to do with Eleanor's murder. She was innocent, and you had accused her based on nothing more than suspicion and circumstantial evidence.

The real killer was never found. The case went cold. Eleanor's murder remained unsolved.

You visited Tombs and Trinkets sometimes, and you'd see Velma there, still browsing, still looking for books. She never said anything to you, but you could see the hurt in her eyes. You'd accused her of murder, and even though the police had cleared her, the accusation had damaged her reputation.

*I was wrong,* you thought. *I let my desire to solve the case cloud my judgment. I accused an innocent person, and I can never take that back.*

Yuzu was still there, still greeting customers with his usual enthusiasm. But when he saw you, he'd look at you with those bright, intelligent eyes, and you'd feel a pang of guilt. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows I made a mistake.*

The truth was never found. Justice was never served. And it was your fault, because you'd been so certain, so sure of yourself, that you'd stopped looking for the real answer.

*I should have been more careful,* you thought. *I should have gathered more evidence. I should have been certain before I accused anyone.*

But it was too late now. The damage was done. The case was cold. And Eleanor's killer was still out there, free.

The story ends here, but the mystery remains unsolved.
