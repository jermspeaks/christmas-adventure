# Piecing Together Arrival Times

You sat down with your notebook, trying to piece together exactly when everyone had arrived at the shop. *If I can figure out the timeline,* you thought, *I can figure out who had the opportunity to kill Eleanor.*

Yuzu curled up at your feet, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

*Let me start with what I know,* you told yourself. *I arrived at the shop around 3:30 PM. I'd been here for maybe an hour before I found Eleanor's body. So it's around 4:30 PM now.*

You thought about the people you'd met. Marcus said he'd been working in the rare books section all afternoon. But when had he arrived? You asked him, and he said he'd been there since 2:00 PM, working on the catalog.

*But there's no evidence of that,* you thought. *No catalog, no notes, nothing.*

You asked Velma when she'd arrived, and she said she'd been there since around 2:30 PM, browsing in the mystery section.

*So if Marcus arrived at 2:00 PM, and Velma arrived at 2:30 PM, and I arrived at 3:30 PM, then all three of us were here when Eleanor was killed,* you thought.

But Eleanor's tea was still warm, which suggested she'd been killed recently. Very recently. Within the last hour or two.

*So if it's 4:30 PM now, and the tea is still warm, then Eleanor was killed sometime between 2:30 PM and 4:30 PM,* you thought.

You looked at Eleanor's calendar, still open on her desk. December 22nd. A note that said "4:00 PM - Important meeting."

*4:00 PM,* you thought. *That was half an hour ago. Was that when she was killed? Was that when she was supposed to meet someone?*

You needed to verify when everyone was where they said they were. You needed to check if anyone could confirm Marcus's alibi, or Velma's alibi, or if there were any witnesses who saw what happened.

What do you do?
