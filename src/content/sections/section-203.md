# Pushed Too Hard

You decided to push harder, to make the magic balance faster, to speed up the process. You didn't want to wait, didn't want to be patient. You wanted results, and you wanted them now.

*I can make this work faster,* you thought. *I just need to push harder.*

But pushing harder only made things worse. The magic became more resistant, more unstable, more dangerous. Your attempts to speed things up created new problems, new imbalances, new chaos.

*No,* you thought. *I need to push even harder.*

You pushed even harder, trying to force the magic to balance faster. But it only made things worse. The magic rebelled, becoming permanently unstable, refusing to balance, refusing to work properly.

*What have I done?* you thought. *I pushed too hard, and I broke everything.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its disappointment. "You pushed too hard," it said, its voice sad. "You tried to speed things up, to force the magic to balance faster. But magic cannot be forced. It must be guided, patiently, carefully. You pushed too hard, and you broke it. The magic is now permanently unstable, refusing to balance, refusing to work properly."

*I pushed too hard,* you realized. *I tried to force it, and I broke it. I created permanent instability.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—unstable, unbalanced, a reminder that some things cannot be forced, that patience is more important than speed, that guidance is the only way to truly help magic find balance.
