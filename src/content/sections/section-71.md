# Accusing Marcus Directly

You confronted Marcus directly, laying out all the evidence you had against him. "I know you killed Eleanor," you said. "I have proof."

Marcus's face went white. "What? No. I didn't—"

"The silver button from your cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk," you said. "Your alibi doesn't hold up—there's no evidence you were working in the rare books section. The letter from Alistair proving you've been stealing books. Eleanor's journal showing she was going to confront you. It all points to you."

Marcus was silent for a long moment. Then he said, "You don't understand. It wasn't like that. I didn't mean to—"

*So he's going to confess?* you thought. *Or is he going to try to explain it away?*

"What happened?" you asked.

Marcus's hands were shaking. "Eleanor found out. About the books. She confronted me. We argued. I... I panicked. I grabbed the letter opener, and... I didn't mean to kill her. It just happened."

*So it was a crime of passion,* you thought. *He didn't plan it. But that doesn't make it any less wrong.*

"You need to tell the police," you said. "You need to confess."

Marcus looked at you, his eyes full of fear and regret. "I know," he said. "I know I do. But I'm scared. What's going to happen to me?"

*That's not your problem to solve,* you thought. *You've found the truth. Now justice needs to be served.*

You looked at Yuzu, who was watching Marcus with those bright, intelligent eyes. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows we found the truth.*

What do you do?
