# Chaos in Starlight Hollow

You made your way toward Starlight Hollow, the Keepsake Keeper warm in your hands, Cheshire trotting at your side. The closer you got to the town, the more obvious the chaos became. Lights flickered wildly—some so bright they hurt to look at, others dimming to almost nothing before flaring back to life. The air itself seemed to shimmer and pulse, and you could feel the magic like a current running through everything, unstable and unpredictable.

*This is worse than I thought,* you realized. *The magic isn't just back—it's out of control.*

As you reached the edge of town, you saw the first signs of what the unstable magic was doing. A Christmas tree in someone's front yard was growing at an alarming rate, its branches reaching toward the sky like it was trying to touch the stars. Across the street, another tree had shrunk to the size of a houseplant, its lights flickering weakly. A wreath on a door was spinning slowly in place, while the door next to it had garlands that seemed frozen in time, their sparkle completely still.

"Something's very wrong here," Cheshire said, their voice worried. "The magic is trying to restore itself, but it doesn't know how much to give. It's like... it's like it's guessing, and guessing wrong."

You stepped into the town square, and that's when you saw the people. They were gathered in small groups, talking in hushed, worried voices. Some looked excited, others frightened. A woman was trying to calm a child whose toy was floating three feet off the ground, spinning slowly. A man was staring at his Christmas lights, which were changing colors faster than you could follow.

*They don't know what to do,* you thought. *They're scared, but they're also... hopeful? Like they want this to work, but they don't know how to make it work right.*

What do you do?
