# Investigating if Velma Knew About the Rare Books

You decided to investigate if Velma knew about the rare book collection and the theft, thinking it might reveal something important.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Velma about the rare book collection, and she seemed surprised. "I know Eleanor had a rare book collection," she said. "She'd mentioned it a few times. But I never saw it. She kept it locked away, very private. She said it was her legacy."

*So she knew about it,* you thought. *But did she know Marcus was stealing from it?*

"Did you know Marcus was stealing books from the collection?" you asked.

Velma's face went pale. "What? No. I had no idea. Eleanor never mentioned anything like that. Are you sure?"

*She seems genuinely surprised,* you thought. *But is she telling the truth?*

You thought about Velma's relationship with Eleanor. They'd been friends for twenty years. If Eleanor had discovered Marcus was stealing, would she have told Velma? Probably. But if Velma knew, would she have told you? Maybe not, if she was trying to protect someone.

*But who would she be protecting?* you wondered. *Marcus? Alistair? Herself?*

You needed to investigate more carefully. You needed to find out if Velma really knew about the theft, or if she was telling the truth.

What do you do?
