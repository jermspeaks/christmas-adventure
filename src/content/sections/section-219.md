# Magic Rebellion

You decided to try to control all the magic yourself, to make it do what you wanted, to be in charge of everything. You thought you could handle it, that you were strong enough. You tried to control it all.

*I can control it all,* you thought. *I'm strong enough.*

But trying to control all the magic only made it rebel. It rejected you completely, refusing to respond, refusing to work. The world lost magic forever, unable to ever get it back.

*What have I done?* you thought. *I tried to control it all, and I lost everything.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light died completely. "You tried to control all the magic," it said, its voice fading. "But magic cannot be controlled. It must be shared, connected, balanced. You tried to control it all, and it rebelled, rejecting you, rejecting the world. Magic is lost forever."

*I tried to control it all,* you realized. *I lost magic forever.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that control is not the answer, that sharing is more important than controlling, that magic must be shared, not controlled.
