# Presenting to Officer Martinez

You found Officer Martinez in the office, where the police were still processing the scene. She looked up as you approached, her expression professional but not unkind.

"I need to talk to you," you said. "I think I've figured out who killed Eleanor."

Officer Martinez raised an eyebrow. "Oh? And who would that be?"

"Marcus Chen," you said. "I have evidence."

You laid out everything you'd found. The silver button that matched Marcus's cardigan. The inconsistencies in his alibi. The letter from Alistair that proved Marcus had been stealing rare books. The torn note that matched Marcus's handwriting. Eleanor's journal entries that showed she was going to confront him.

Officer Martinez listened carefully, taking notes. "This is compelling," she said. "But we'll need to verify everything. The handwriting, the button, the financial records. We can't just arrest someone based on circumstantial evidence."

*But it's not just circumstantial,* you thought. *The button is physical evidence. The handwriting can be verified. The financial records can be checked.*

"I understand," you said. "But I'm certain. Marcus killed Eleanor. He was stealing from her, she found out, and he killed her to keep her from exposing him."

Officer Martinez nodded. "We'll look into it. But I need you to let us handle this from here. This is a police investigation, and we need to do it properly."

*But I've already done so much,* you thought. *I've found the evidence. I've solved the case. I can't just stop now.*

What do you do?
