# Solo Attempt

You held up the Keepsake Keeper, focusing all your energy on trying to redistribute the magic yourself. *I can do this,* you thought. *I have the Keepsake Keeper. I understand the problem. I can fix it.*

You channeled the Keepsake Keeper's power, trying to guide the magic, to show it where to go, to help it find balance. The magic responded, but it was... hesitant. Uncertain. Like it wasn't sure if it should trust you, if you were the right person to guide it.

*It's not working as well as I thought,* you realized, watching as the magic moved slowly, uncertainly, not quite finding its balance. *Maybe I need help. Maybe I can't do this alone.*

You tried harder, pushing more energy through the Keepsake Keeper, trying to force the magic to understand, to balance. But the magic resisted. It didn't want to be forced. It wanted to be guided, to be shown, to be understood. And you were trying to do it all yourself, without connection, without help.

*The magic needs connection,* you thought. *It needs to see that we're all in this together, that we all deserve Christmas magic. But I'm trying to do it alone, and the magic doesn't respond to that.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes gentle. "The magic responds to connection," they said. "It needs to see that we're all working together, that we all care, that we all want to help. When you try to do it alone, the magic doesn't understand. It needs to see the connection."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly. "The magic needs to be guided by connection, not by one person alone," it said. "It needs to see that we're all in this together, that we all deserve Christmas magic. When you try to do it alone, you're missing that connection, and the magic doesn't respond as well."

*So I need help,* you thought. *I need to work with others, to show the magic that we're all connected, that we all care. I can't do this alone.*

What do you do?
