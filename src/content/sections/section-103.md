# Checking the Inventory Records

You decided to check the inventory records, thinking that would help you prove Marcus had been stealing books.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You found the inventory records in Eleanor's filing cabinet, and you compared them to the actual collection. Sure enough, there were discrepancies. Several rare books that should have been in the collection were missing.

You also found records of sales—books that were sold to dealers, including Alistair Finch, with the money going into Marcus's account.

*So there's definitely evidence of missing books,* you thought. *And Marcus was selling them.*

You also found Eleanor's notes about the discrepancies. She'd been checking the inventory, and she'd noticed books were missing. She'd written notes about it, dated over the past few weeks.

*So she'd discovered the theft,* you thought. *She was checking the inventory. And she was going to confront Marcus about it.*

*So Marcus had been stealing books,* you thought. *Eleanor had discovered it. And he killed her to keep her from exposing him.*

You needed to present all this evidence to Officer Martinez, or confront Marcus with it directly.

What do you do?
