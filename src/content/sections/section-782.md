# Helping Others See the Pattern

You helped the townspeople see the pattern themselves, guiding them, showing them, helping them understand what the stories revealed.

You worked with them, discussing the stories, comparing the places, seeing the differences. And as you did, you saw understanding growing, patterns becoming clear, solutions beginning to form.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as understanding spread, as people began to see the pattern, as solutions began to form. *By helping others see the pattern, I'm helping them understand, helping them find solutions, helping them help the magic learn.*

Cheshire trotted between groups, helping where needed, their presence thoughtful. "You're helping them understand," they said. "You're guiding them, showing them, helping them see the pattern. That's what understanding needs—not just being told, but seeing, recognizing, understanding for themselves."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Understanding creates solutions," it said. "When you help others see the pattern, when you guide them to understand, when you help them find solutions, you create stronger understanding, better solutions, more effective help. That's what you're doing now."

You looked around, at the way understanding was spreading, at the way patterns were becoming clear, at the way solutions were beginning to form. *This is working,* you thought. *By helping others see the pattern, I'm helping them understand, helping them find solutions, helping them help the magic learn.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some people understood easily, but others needed more time, more guidance, more explanation.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some people need more help, more time, more understanding. How do we help everyone?*

What do you do?
