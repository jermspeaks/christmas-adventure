# Patient Teaching

You took a deep breath and stepped back. *I need to slow down,* you thought. *I need to teach in smaller groups, one thing at a time.*

"Let's break this into smaller groups," you said to the gathered crowd. "I'll work with a few people at a time, and we'll learn together, step by step."

You started with Elara and a few others, focusing on just one thing—how to connect with a memory, how to feel the emotion, how to let the magic respond. You didn't try to explain everything at once. You just focused on that one thing, helping them understand it, practice it, feel it.

*This is better,* you realized, watching as Elara's face lit up with understanding. *They're getting it. They're understanding, one piece at a time.*

You worked through the groups slowly, patiently, helping each person understand one concept before moving to the next. And as you did, you saw the understanding growing. People weren't overwhelmed anymore. They were learning, step by step, piece by piece.

*This is how teaching should work,* you thought. *Slowly, patiently, one thing at a time.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes bright. "You're doing it right," they said. "Teaching takes time. Understanding takes time. You're giving people the space to learn, to process, to understand. That's what they need."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Patience is a teacher's greatest tool," it said. "When you slow down, when you teach in smaller pieces, people can understand. They can learn. They can grow. That's how true understanding happens."

You looked at the groups, at the way people were learning, at the way understanding was spreading. *This is working,* you realized. *People are learning. They're understanding. And it's happening because I slowed down, because I taught in smaller groups, because I gave them time.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some people were still struggling, even in the smaller groups. They needed more help, more guidance, more time. And you were only one person, trying to teach everyone.

*I'm making progress,* you thought. *But there are still people who need help. I can't reach everyone at once, even in smaller groups.*

What do you do?
