# Asking Marcus About Inconsistencies

You decided to focus on the inconsistencies in Marcus's story, thinking that would be the best way to get him to reveal the truth.

Yuzu stayed close, watching Marcus carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

"You said you were working in the rare books section all afternoon," you said. "But there's no evidence of that. No catalog, no notes, nothing. How do you explain that?"

Marcus's face tightened. "I... I finished it. I put everything away. That's how I work—I clean up as I go."

*But that doesn't make sense,* you thought. *If you were cataloging a new acquisition, there should be evidence of that.*

"You said you were working on a first edition of *The Maltese Falcon*," you said. "But that book looks like it's been here for a while. It's already cataloged, already priced. When did you actually work on it?"

Marcus's face went pale. "I... I don't remember exactly. Earlier today. This morning, maybe."

*But you said you were working on it this afternoon,* you thought. *When Eleanor was killed.*

"You also said you weren't in the office," you continued. "But we found a silver button from your cardigan near Eleanor's desk. How do you explain that?"

Marcus was silent for a long moment. Then he said, "I... I don't know. Maybe I was in the office earlier. I don't remember."

*But that doesn't make sense either,* you thought. *If you were in the office earlier, why didn't you mention it? Why did you say you were in the rare books section the whole time?*

"You're lying," you said. "Your story doesn't add up. You're hiding something."

Marcus's face tightened. "I'm not lying," he said. "I'm telling you the truth."

*But the evidence says otherwise,* you thought.

What do you do?
