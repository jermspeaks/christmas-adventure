# Investigating if Velma Has a History of Taking Things

You decided to investigate if Velma had a history of taking things, thinking that might reveal something about her character.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez about Velma's history, and she told you what she knew. "We've looked into Velma," she said. "She's a regular customer, has been coming here for twenty years. Eleanor mentioned that Velma sometimes 'borrowed' books to examine them more closely before purchasing, but she always paid for them or brought them back. It was a habit, but not a crime."

*So she had a habit of borrowing books,* you thought. *But she always paid for them. So it's not really stealing.*

*But that doesn't mean she's innocent,* you thought. *It just means the book isn't the key to the mystery.*

You also thought about the murder. The physical evidence points to Marcus, not Velma. The silver button from Marcus's cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk. Marcus's motive, his lack of an alibi, his confession.

*So it's probably Marcus,* you thought. *Velma is probably innocent. The book is a red herring.*

You needed to focus on Marcus, and gather more evidence against him.

What do you do?
