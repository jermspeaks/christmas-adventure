# Problems Emerge

You accepted that the celebration was perfect, thinking everything was resolved. You celebrated, thinking the problems were solved. But the Keepsake Keeper was right—the problems were only being ignored, not truly addressed.

When the celebration ended, the problems emerged. They were worse than before, having grown in the shadows, having been ignored. Everything fell apart, and the celebration ended in disaster.

*I should have addressed them,* you thought, watching everything fall apart. *I should have dealt with the problems. I should have found the real solution.*

But it was too late. The problems were too big, and there was no way to fix them.

The story ends here, but the problems remain—worse than before, destroying everything, a reminder that ignoring problems doesn't make them go away, that addressing them is more important than pretending they don't exist.
