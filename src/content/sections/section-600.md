# Natural Patterns

You stepped back, letting the magic flow naturally, just watching, just observing. *Maybe if I understand how it works naturally,* you thought, *I can help it better.*

As you watched, you began to notice patterns you hadn't seen before. The magic wasn't just flowing randomly—it was following connections. It flowed toward places where people were together, where memories were being made, where joy was being shared. It avoided places where there was loneliness, where connections were broken, where memories had been lost.

*It's about connection,* you realized. *The magic flows toward connection, toward togetherness, toward shared joy. It avoids disconnection, loneliness, broken bonds.*

You watched as a stream of magic flowed toward a small house where a family was decorating their tree together, their laughter carrying on the wind. The magic settled there, warm and steady, responding to their connection, their shared joy.

But then you saw another stream hesitate near a house that was dark, empty, where someone was alone. The magic seemed to want to go there, to bring light and warmth, but it didn't know how. It didn't know how to connect to a place that had lost its connections.

*That's the problem,* you thought. *The magic wants to help, but it doesn't know how to reach places that have lost their connections. It needs someone to help it understand, to show it the way.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes bright with understanding. "You're seeing it," they said. "The magic flows toward connection, toward togetherness. But it needs help reaching places where connections have been broken. It needs someone to help it understand that even broken connections can be mended."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "The magic understands connection," it said. "But it doesn't always understand how to create it, how to mend it. It needs guidance, someone to help it see that even the loneliest places can be reached, that even broken connections can be healed."

*So the magic needs help understanding how to reach places that have lost their connections,* you thought. *It needs someone to guide it, to show it the way, to help it understand that connection can be created, not just found.*

What do you do?
