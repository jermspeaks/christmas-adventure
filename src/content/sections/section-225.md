# Ignored Magic

You decided to ignore the magic, to let it do whatever it wanted, to stop trying to help. You thought it would figure itself out, that you didn't need to do anything. You ignored it completely.

*It will figure itself out,* you thought. *I don't need to do anything.*

But ignoring the magic only made things worse. It became permanently chaotic, unstable, dangerous. Everything fell apart, and there was no way to fix it.

*I ignored it,* you realized. *I lost everything.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You ignored the magic," it said, its voice sad. "You thought it would figure itself out, but magic needs guidance. Without it, it became permanently chaotic, unstable, dangerous. Everything fell apart."

*I ignored it,* you realized. *I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains chaotic—permanently, a reminder that ignoring problems doesn't make them go away, that guidance is more important than ignoring.
