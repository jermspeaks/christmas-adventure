# The Truth Emerges

You followed Yuzu back to Eleanor's office, where the police were still working. The scene had been processed, but you could still see the outline where Eleanor's body had been, and it made your chest tighten.

Yuzu went straight to a filing cabinet in the corner, one you hadn't really noticed before. He pawed at the bottom drawer, whining softly.

*What is it, boy?* You knelt down and pulled the drawer open. It was filled with files, but at the very back, tucked behind everything else, was a small envelope. You pulled it out carefully.

Inside was a letter, written in handwriting you recognized from the business card—Alistair Finch's handwriting. But this wasn't a threat. This was something else entirely.

*Eleanor,* it read. *I know what Marcus has been doing. I can prove he's been stealing from your collection. Meet me tonight, and I'll give you all the evidence. But you have to act before Christmas Eve, or I'll take it to the authorities myself. I'm sorry it's come to this, but you deserve to know the truth.*

*Oh,* you thought. *So Alistair wasn't threatening Eleanor. He was trying to help her. He was going to give her evidence against Marcus.*

But then you noticed something else. The letter was dated December 20th. But the torn note Yuzu had found—"before Christmas Eve or else"—that had been written more recently. And the handwriting was different.

You pulled out the torn note fragment again, comparing it to the letter. The handwriting didn't match Alistair's at all. It was sharper, more angular. More like...

*Marcus's handwriting.*

You found a catalog Marcus had been working on, comparing the handwriting. It matched. Marcus had written the threatening note, probably to make it look like Alistair was the one threatening Eleanor, to throw suspicion away from himself.

*So here's what happened,* you thought, piecing it together. *Marcus had been stealing rare books and selling them. Alistair found out and wrote to Eleanor, offering to give her proof. Marcus intercepted that letter, or found out about it somehow. He wrote a fake threatening note to make it look like Alistair was the bad guy. Then, when Eleanor confronted him tonight—probably after finding evidence herself—he panicked. He grabbed the letter opener, and...*

You looked at the silver button in your hand. Marcus's button. It must have come off during the struggle.

You found Officer Martinez and showed her everything—the letter from Alistair, the torn note that matched Marcus's handwriting, the button, and your theory about what had happened.

"We'll need to verify the handwriting," she said, "but this is compelling evidence. And we found something else—Marcus's financial records show large deposits over the past few months, deposits that match the timing of several rare book sales. Sales that weren't authorized by Eleanor."

You felt a strange mix of satisfaction and sadness. *We solved it,* you thought. *But Eleanor is still dead.*

Yuzu pressed against your leg, and you knelt down to pet him. "You're a good detective, you know that?" you said. "You found the first clue. You led me here. You found the button. You found the letter."

Yuzu's tail wagged, and he licked your hand, as if to say, *Of course I did. That's what good dogs do.*

Officer Martinez approached Marcus, who was still in the shop, looking more nervous than ever. "Marcus Chen," she said, her voice formal. "I need to ask you some questions. And I think you should have a lawyer present."

Marcus's face went white, and you saw his hand go to his cardigan, to where the missing button should have been. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows we've figured it out.*

As the police led Marcus away, you stood in the bookshop, surrounded by books and Christmas lights and the lingering smell of peppermint cocoa. It should have felt like a victory, solving the mystery, but it just felt sad.

*Eleanor is dead,* you thought. *And it was someone she trusted. Someone who worked for her, who she was going to leave the shop to.*

Yuzu whined softly, and you looked down at him. "I know, buddy," you said. "It's not a happy ending, is it?"

But Yuzu's tail wagged again, and he trotted over to the Christmas tree, sitting down beneath it as if to say, *But we did the right thing. We found the truth. That has to count for something.*

What do you do?
