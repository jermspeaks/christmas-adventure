# Checking if Anyone Can Verify Marcus's Alibi

You decided to check if anyone could verify Marcus's alibi, thinking that would help you determine if he was telling the truth.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez if there were any witnesses who could verify Marcus's alibi, and she shook her head. "We've interviewed everyone who was in the shop," she said. "No one saw Marcus in the rare books section. No one can verify his alibi."

*So he doesn't have an alibi,* you thought. *No one can confirm where he was.*

You also asked about security cameras, and Officer Martinez shook her head again. "There are no security cameras in the shop," she said. "Eleanor didn't have them installed."

*So there's no video evidence,* you thought. *No way to verify where Marcus was.*

You thought about the physical evidence instead. The silver button from Marcus's cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk. *That's physical evidence,* you thought. *That proves Marcus was in the office.*

*So Marcus was in the office,* you thought. *He was there when Eleanor was killed. And he doesn't have an alibi. And he has motive. It all points to him.*

You needed to confront him with all this evidence, and get him to confess.

What do you do?
