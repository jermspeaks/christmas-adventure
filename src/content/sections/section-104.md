# Asking Velma to Describe What She Saw

You asked Velma to describe exactly what she saw when she found Eleanor, thinking that would help you understand what happened.

Yuzu stayed close, watching Velma carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

Velma took a deep breath, then said, "I went to the office to ask Eleanor about a book. I found her there. On the floor. Behind her desk. I panicked. I didn't know what to do, so I went back to browsing, trying to process what I'd seen."

*That's a strange reaction,* you thought. *Most people would call for help immediately. But she went back to browsing?*

"What time was this?" you asked.

"I don't know exactly," Velma said. "Maybe 3:30? 4:00? I'm not sure. I was in shock. I wasn't paying attention to the time."

*But Eleanor's tea was still warm,* you thought. *Which suggests she was killed recently. If Velma found her at 3:30 or 4:00, and the tea was still warm, then Eleanor was killed around that time.*

"Did you see anyone else?" you asked. "Did you hear anything? Did you notice anything unusual?"

Velma shook her head. "No. Nothing. The office was quiet. Eleanor was just... there. On the floor. I didn't see anyone else. I didn't hear anything."

*But someone had to be there,* you thought. *Someone killed Eleanor. And if Velma found her right after, then the killer might have still been nearby.*

*Or,* you thought, *Velma could be lying. She could be the killer.*

You needed to investigate more carefully. You needed to check if her story matched the evidence, and why she didn't call for help immediately.

What do you do?
