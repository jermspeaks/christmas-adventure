# Taken for Granted

You decided to take the magic for granted and stop working at it, to assume it would always be there, to not appreciate it. You thought it was permanent, that you didn't need to work at it. You took it for granted.

*It will always be there,* you thought. *I don't need to work at it.*

But taking magic for granted only made it fade, becoming weaker, disappearing. Eventually, it was gone, and there was no way to get it back.

*The magic is fading,* you thought. *It's going away.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You took the magic for granted," it said, its voice sad. "But magic requires appreciation, work, connection. You took it for granted, and it faded, becoming weaker, disappearing completely."

*I took it for granted,* you realized. *I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains gone—faded, disappeared, a reminder that appreciation is essential, that work is more important than taking things for granted.
