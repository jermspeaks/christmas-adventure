# Stepping Back

You stopped. You stepped back. *I was rushing,* you realized, watching as Kvothe's breathing began to slow, as the panic in their eyes began to fade. *I was trying to help, but I was making it worse.*

"I'm sorry," you said, your voice quiet. "I was rushing. I was trying to help, but I was going too fast. I should have... I should have asked what you needed."

Kvothe looked at you, and for the first time, you saw something in their eyes besides overwhelm—gratitude. "Thank you," they said, their voice shaky but clear. "For stopping. For... for seeing that it was too much."

The memories around them were still swirling, but slower now, less chaotic. The panic was receding, replaced by something else—uncertainty, maybe, but also a willingness to try.

*They're not shutting down anymore,* you thought. *They're processing. Just... slowly.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed gently. "Recognizing a mistake and correcting it is its own kind of wisdom," it said. "You saw that you were rushing, and you stopped. That's what matters."

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes kind. "Sometimes the best help is knowing when to slow down," they said. "When to step back. When to let someone process at their own pace."

You looked at Kvothe, at the way they were breathing, at the way they were beginning to process the memories, slowly, carefully. *They need to go at their own pace,* you thought. *And I need to be patient enough to let them.*

"I'm here," you said. "When you're ready. At whatever pace you need."

Kvothe nodded, and you saw the first flicker of a real smile. "Thank you," they said again. "For understanding."
