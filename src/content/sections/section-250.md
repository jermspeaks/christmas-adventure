# False Celebration

You decided to focus only on celebration and ignore remaining challenges, to pretend everything was perfect, to not address problems. You thought the celebration was enough, that problems didn't matter. You ignored them.

*The celebration is enough,* you thought. *Problems don't matter.*

But ignoring problems only made them worse, hidden beneath the celebration. Eventually, they exploded, destroying everything, and the celebration ended in disaster.

*The problems exploded,* you thought. *Everything is destroyed.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You ignored the problems," it said, its voice sad. "But problems don't disappear when ignored. They grow, hidden, until they explode. You ignored them, and they destroyed everything."

*I ignored them,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the problems remain—exploded, destroying, a reminder that ignoring problems doesn't make them go away, that addressing them is more important than pretending.
