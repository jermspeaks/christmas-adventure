# Asking Velma About Conflicts with Eleanor

You asked Velma about any recent conflicts with Eleanor, thinking that might reveal something about their relationship.

Yuzu stayed close, watching Velma carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

Velma hesitated, then said, "We... we had a disagreement. A few weeks ago. About a book. I wanted to buy it, but Eleanor wouldn't sell it. She said it was part of her personal collection, not for sale. I was upset. I thought, after all these years, she could make an exception. But she wouldn't."

*So there was tension,* you thought. *But was it enough to lead to murder? Probably not.*

"What book was it?" you asked.

"A first edition of *The Great Gatsby*," Velma said. "It was beautiful. I wanted it so badly. But Eleanor wouldn't sell it. She said it was special to her, that it had been a gift."

*Interesting,* you thought. *But still, that doesn't seem like a motive for murder.*

You also thought about the physical evidence. The silver button from Marcus's cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk. *That points to Marcus, not Velma,* you thought.

*So Velma probably didn't do it,* you thought. *The evidence points to Marcus.*

You needed to focus on Marcus, and gather more evidence against him.

What do you do?
