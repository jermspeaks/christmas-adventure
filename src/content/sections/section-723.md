# Asking for Help

You turned to the others, to Cheshire, to the Keepsake Keeper, to the people around you. "I can't do this alone," you said. "Kvothe needs support, and the world needs help. Can others help while I focus on Kvothe? Can we work together to do both?"

Cheshire's eyes brightened, and they nodded. "Of course," they said. "We can help. We can support Kvothe while you help the world, or help the world while you support Kvothe. Together, we can do both."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Asking for help is important," it said. "When you realize you can't do everything alone, when you ask others to help, you can do more, help more, support more. Together, you can support Kvothe and help the world."

You looked around, and you saw it—people who were willing to help, who wanted to support, who cared about both Kvothe and the world. Together, you began to work—some supporting Kvothe, some helping the world, all working together.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as Kvothe got the support they needed, as the world got the help it needed, as everyone worked together. *By asking for help, by working together, we're doing both—supporting Kvothe and helping the world.*

Cheshire trotted between groups, helping where needed, their presence supportive. "This is how it should be done," they said. "Together, supporting each other, helping each other, working together to do both. When you ask for help and work together, you can do more, help more, support more."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Asking for help creates connection," it said. "When you realize you can't do everything alone, when you ask others to help, when you work together, you create stronger connections, better solutions, more effective support. That's what you're doing now."

You looked around, at the way people were working together, at the way Kvothe was getting support, at the way the world was getting help. *This is working,* you thought. *By asking for help, by working together, we're doing both—supporting Kvothe and helping the world.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some tasks were easy to share, but others were more complex. Some support was simple to provide, but other help needed more time, more understanding, more work.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some tasks need more attention, more collaboration, more understanding. How do we address all of them?*

What do you do?
