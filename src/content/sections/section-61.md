# Requesting to Join the Investigation

You asked Officer Martinez if you could be part of the official investigation, and her expression became serious. "I understand you want to help," she said. "And you've been very helpful so far. But this is a police investigation. We have procedures we need to follow. We can't have civilians directly involved in the investigation."

*But I've already found so much,* you thought. *I've already done so much. Why can't I keep going?*

"I appreciate everything you've done," Officer Martinez continued. "You found the body, you found evidence, you've been very observant. But now we need to take over. We need to process everything properly, verify all the evidence, and conduct the investigation according to protocol."

*But I'm so close,* you thought. *I can feel it. I'm almost there.*

"You can still help," Officer Martinez said. "If you remember anything else, if you find anything else, let us know. But we can't have you actively investigating. That's our job."

*I understand,* you thought. *But I don't want to stop. I want to see this through.*

You looked at Yuzu, who was watching you with those bright, intelligent eyes. *What do you think, buddy?* you thought. *Should I keep going? Or should I step back?*

Yuzu tilted his head, as if considering the question. Then he looked toward the office, then back at you, as if to say, *We're not done yet.*

*You're right,* you thought. *We're not done yet.*

What do you do?
