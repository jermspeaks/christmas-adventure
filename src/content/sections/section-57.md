# The Book Velma Took

You asked Velma about the book she'd taken, and she showed you the receipt. It was dated that morning, for a first edition of *Murder on the Orient Express*. The receipt looked legitimate.

*But that doesn't mean she didn't take something else,* you thought. *Or that the book isn't important for some other reason.*

You looked at the book more carefully. It was a first edition, leather-bound, clearly valuable. But was it valuable enough to be a motive for murder? Probably not.

*Unless there was something hidden in it,* you thought. *A note, a clue, something important.*

"Can I see the book?" you asked.

Velma handed it to you, and you flipped through it carefully. Nothing. Just pages of text. No hidden notes, no clues, nothing unusual.

*So it really was just a book,* you thought. *She really was just buying it. My suspicion was wrong.*

But that didn't mean Velma was innocent. It just meant the book wasn't the key to the mystery.

*I need to look elsewhere,* you thought. *I need to find the real evidence.*

What do you do?
