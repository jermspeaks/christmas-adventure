# Looking for Evidence of a Deeper Relationship

You decided to look for evidence of a deeper relationship between Velma and Eleanor, thinking that might reveal something important.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You went through Eleanor's personal files and journal, looking for any mention of a deeper relationship with Velma. You found entries about their friendship:

*December 5th: Had tea with Velma today. She's such a good friend. I'm lucky to have her.*
*December 12th: Velma's book club is reading my favorite mystery. We talked about it for hours.*

*So they were good friends,* you thought. *Close friends. Would someone kill a close friend? Probably not.*

You also thought about the physical evidence. The silver button from Marcus's cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk. *That points to Marcus, not Velma,* you thought.

*So Velma probably didn't do it,* you thought. *The evidence points to Marcus. They were friends, and there's no real motive for Velma to kill Eleanor.*

You needed to focus on Marcus, and gather more evidence against him.

What do you do?
