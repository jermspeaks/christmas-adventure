# The Explosion

You accepted the suppressed magic as the solution, thinking everything was fixed. You celebrated, thinking the problem was solved. But the Keepsake Keeper was right—the magic was only suppressed, not balanced.

Weeks passed, and the suppression began to weaken. The magic started to build up, pressure growing, tension increasing. And then, one day, it exploded.

The magic burst free with more force than before, destroying everything in its path. Starlight Hollow was devastated. The forest was destroyed. The magic became permanently chaotic, unstable, dangerous.

*I should have listened,* you thought, watching the destruction. *I should have investigated. I should have found the real solution.*

But it was too late. The magic was broken, and there was no way to fix it.

The story ends here, but the magic continues—chaotic, unstable, a reminder that suppression is not the same as balance, that temporary fixes are not solutions, that investigating problems is more important than accepting false solutions.
