# Addressing Problems

You moved through the celebration, addressing the problems you'd noticed. You found the group trying to use the magic the old way, and you helped them understand the new way. You found the place where the magic was unbalanced, and you helped it find balance. You found the fragile connection, and you helped strengthen it.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as problems began to resolve, as things began to balance, as connections began to strengthen. *By addressing problems early, I'm preventing them from growing.*

You worked through the celebration, staying alert, addressing problems as you found them. And as you did, you saw the celebration becoming more stable, more balanced, more joyful. The magic was flowing better, people were understanding more, connections were growing stronger.

*This is what I should be doing,* you realized. *Staying alert, addressing problems early, helping things stay balanced. I can celebrate and help at the same time.*

Cheshire trotted beside you, their eyes bright. "You're doing both," they said. "You're celebrating and helping. You're staying alert and addressing problems. That's what awareness does—it lets you enjoy the celebration while also helping when needed."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Awareness is a gift," it said. "When you notice problems early, you can address them before they grow. You can help things stay balanced, help connections stay strong, help the celebration stay joyful. That's what you're doing now."

You looked around, at the celebration, at the joy, at the way problems were being resolved. *This is working,* you thought. *By staying alert, by addressing problems early, I'm helping the celebration stay balanced, stay joyful, stay connected.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some problems were easy to address, but others were more complex. Some connections were simple to strengthen, but others needed more time, more understanding, more work.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some problems need more attention, more time, more understanding. How do we address all of them?*

What do you do?
