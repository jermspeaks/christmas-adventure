# Toward the Frostwood Forest

You made your decision. Whether the Keepsake Keeper had told you directly, or you'd learned it from the pattern in its light, or Cheshire had explained it to you—you knew where you needed to go. The Frostwood Forest. Waiting around wasn't going to solve anything. *Besides,* you thought, *how dangerous can a forest called "Frostwood" really be?* (You were about to find out, and you had a feeling the answer was "more dangerous than you'd like.")

"Let's go," you said, holding the Keepsake Keeper ornament carefully. Its light pulsed gently in your hands, like a heartbeat. "The Frostwood Forest, right? Lead the way."

Cheshire looked at you with an expression that was equal parts admiration and concern. "Are you sure? The forest is... well, it's not a friendly place. The magic there has been fading faster than anywhere else. It's like the heart of the problem."

"All the more reason to go," you said, feeling more determined than you had a moment ago. "If that's where the magic is being stolen from, that's where we need to be."

The Keepsake Keeper's light brightened slightly. "I can guide you," it said, its voice a little stronger now. "Follow the trail of fading magic. Where the lights are dimmest, where the snow doesn't sparkle—that's the path. The magic has been pulled in that direction, and if you follow it backward, you'll find the source."

You set off, Cheshire trotting alongside you. The path out of Starlight Hollow led through fields of snow that should have sparkled like diamonds but instead looked... ordinary. Flat. Like someone had forgotten to add the magic.

*This is depressing,* you thought. *Even the snow is sad.*

As you walked, you noticed something strange. The further you got from the village, the more the landscape changed. The snow became heavier, the trees taller and more imposing. The sky, which had been a soft twilight purple, grew darker, the stars dimmer. And the air—the air felt different. Colder, yes, but also emptier, as if something essential had been removed.

"The Frostwood Forest," Cheshire said quietly, their voice barely above a whisper. "We're getting close. Can you feel it? The magic is thinner here. Like someone's been draining it away."

You could feel it. The world around you felt less alive, less magical. Even the Keepsake Keeper in your hands seemed to dim slightly, its light struggling against the emptiness.

In the distance, you could see the edge of the forest—tall, dark trees with branches heavy with snow that didn't sparkle at all. The forest looked ancient and foreboding, and you had the distinct feeling that it didn't want visitors.

*Well,* you thought, *this is going to be interesting.*

What do you do?
