# Investigating if Eleanor Was Planning to Fire Marcus

You decided to investigate if Eleanor was planning to fire Marcus, thinking that would reveal more about his motive.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez if there was any evidence that Eleanor was planning to fire Marcus, and she nodded. "We found a draft of a termination letter in her files," she said. "Dated yesterday. She was going to fire him for stealing books from the collection."

*So she was definitely going to fire him,* you thought. *And if she fired him, he would have lost everything—his job, his inheritance, his reputation.*

*That's a strong motive,* you thought. *If Marcus found out she was going to fire him, and he would lose everything, then he might have killed her to keep her from doing it.*

You also thought about Eleanor's journal entry: *December 22nd: Tonight. I'll confront them tonight. It has to end.*

*She was going to confront him tonight,* you thought. *She was going to fire him. And he killed her before she could.*

*So Marcus had motive,* you thought. *He had opportunity. And he has physical evidence against him. It all points to him.*

You needed to confront him with all this evidence, and get him to confess.

What do you do?
