# Letting the Police Verify

You stepped back and let Officer Martinez and her team handle the verification. You'd found the evidence, you'd put together the theory, but now it was time for the professionals to do their job.

"I'll let you verify everything," you said. "The handwriting, the button, the financial records. I trust you'll do it properly."

Officer Martinez nodded. "We will. And I appreciate your help. You've given us a strong direction. But we need to do this the right way, with proper verification and documentation."

You waited. You watched as the police did their investigation. They verified the handwriting on the torn note. They tested the button to confirm it came from Marcus's cardigan. They traced the financial records, following the money trail from the rare book sales to Marcus's accounts.

It took time. More time than you'd expected. But eventually, they had enough. They had verified enough of the evidence to make an arrest.

Marcus was taken into custody. The case was moving forward. The truth had been found.

But as you watched the investigation unfold, you realized there were things you hadn't found. Details the police had uncovered that you'd missed. Questions they'd asked that you hadn't thought to ask. Evidence they'd gathered that you hadn't even looked for.

*I solved it,* you thought. *I found the truth. But the police found more. They found things I missed.*

You'd given them a good start. You'd pointed them in the right direction. But you hadn't found everything. You'd stopped too soon. You'd assumed you had enough, when there was always more to discover.

The truth had been found, as much of it as you could find. But you'd always wonder about the details you'd missed. The questions you hadn't asked. The evidence you hadn't gathered.
