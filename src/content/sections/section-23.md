# Examining the Scene

Your hands were shaking, but you forced yourself to focus. *I need to look at everything before the police arrive,* you thought. *Before the scene gets contaminated. Before someone moves something important.*

Yuzu stayed close, his warm body pressed against your leg, as if he understood that you needed his presence to stay grounded. The office was small, cluttered in the way that bookshop offices always were—stacks of books, papers, invoices, and catalogs everywhere. But there was something else, something that made the space feel wrong.

The torn note fragment that Yuzu had found was still in your hand. You looked at it more carefully now, turning it over, examining the edges. The paper was expensive, cream-colored, the kind used for formal correspondence. The handwriting was sharp, angular, written in what looked like black ink. The words "...before Christmas Eve or else..." were all that remained.

*Before Christmas Eve or else what?* You looked around the office, wondering if there were more pieces of this note somewhere.

The letter opener was still on the floor where Yuzu had found it. You knelt down, careful not to touch it, and examined it. It was ornate, with an ivory handle carved into the shape of a book. The blade was dark with what you knew was blood. But something about it seemed off. It was part of a set—you could see the empty space on Eleanor's desk where the rest of the set should have been. A matching letter opener, a paper knife, maybe a pen holder.

*Why would someone use Eleanor's own letter opener?* Unless they didn't plan it. Unless it was a crime of passion, something that happened in the moment.

You looked around the office more carefully. Eleanor's desk calendar was open to December 22nd, with several appointments crossed out. A half-finished cup of tea sat on the corner of her desk, still warm to the touch.

*Someone was here recently. Very recently.*

What do you do?
