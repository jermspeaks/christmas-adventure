# Overwhelming Instruction

You gathered everyone in the town square, all of them looking at you with hope and confusion. *I'll teach them all at once,* you thought. *I'll explain everything, and then they'll understand.*

You started talking, explaining the transformed magic, how it worked, what it meant. You explained about connection, about memory, about emotion. You explained about how it wasn't about control anymore, how it was about sharing, about understanding.

But as you talked, you could see the confusion growing. People's faces were blank, overwhelmed. They were trying to follow along, but there was too much information, too many new concepts, too much to understand all at once.

*They're not getting it,* you realized, watching as people's eyes glazed over, as they looked at each other with uncertainty. *I'm explaining too much, too fast.*

Elara stepped forward, her expression kind but concerned. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm trying to understand, but... there's so much. The magic is about connection? And memory? And emotion? And it's not about control? I don't... I don't understand how to use it."

*I'm overwhelming them,* you thought. *They need to learn slowly, one thing at a time, not everything at once.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes gentle. "Teaching takes time," they said. "Understanding takes time. You can't teach everything at once—people need to learn slowly, to process, to understand one thing before they can understand the next."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly. "The magic is complex," it said. "It's not something that can be understood all at once. People need time, patience, small steps. They need to learn one thing at a time, to practice, to understand before they can move on."

*So I need to slow down,* you thought. *I need to teach in smaller pieces, to help people understand one thing at a time, not everything at once.*

You looked at the gathered crowd, at their confused faces, at their hope mixed with uncertainty. *They want to learn,* you realized. *They just need me to teach them in a way they can understand.*

What do you do?
