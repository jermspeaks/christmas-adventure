# Perfectionism

You decided to try to master it completely before helping others, to be perfect, to not make mistakes. You thought you needed to be perfect, that you couldn't help until you were. You tried to be perfect.

*I need to be perfect,* you thought. *I can't help until I am.*

But trying to be perfect only made you never help anyone. You kept waiting, kept trying, never reaching perfection. Meanwhile, people needed help, and you weren't there.

*I'm not perfect yet,* you thought. *I can't help.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You tried to be perfect," it said, its voice sad. "But perfection is impossible. Meanwhile, people needed help, and you weren't there. You waited, and you never helped anyone."

*I tried to be perfect,* you realized. *I never helped anyone.*

The story ends here, but you remain alone—never having helped, never having connected, a reminder that perfection is impossible, that helping is more important than being perfect.
