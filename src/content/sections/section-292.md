# Deep Understanding

You noticed that the understanding seemed shallow, and you decided to help everyone go deeper. You began to teach true understanding, true connection, true mastery. It was harder, took longer, but it was real. It was true understanding, not shallow learning.

*I need to help them go deeper,* you thought. *I need to help them truly understand, to truly connect, to truly master it.*

You began working on deep understanding, helping everyone go deeper, truly connecting, truly understanding. The community began to strengthen, the connections deepening, the magic flourishing.

*This is the right way,* you thought. *This is how it should be done.*

What do you do?
