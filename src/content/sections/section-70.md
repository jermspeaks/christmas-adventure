# Searching for Other People Who Might Be Involved

You decided to investigate if there were any other people who might be involved in the murder, thinking you might have missed someone.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez about other people who might have been in the shop, and she told you what she knew. "We've interviewed everyone who was in the shop this afternoon," she said. "There were a few other customers, but they all have alibis. They were in different parts of the shop, and they didn't see anything suspicious."

*So it's probably one of the three main suspects,* you thought. *Marcus, Velma, or Alistair.*

You also asked about other employees, and Officer Martinez shook her head. "Eleanor ran the shop mostly by herself, with Marcus as her assistant. There were no other employees."

*So it's definitely one of the three,* you thought. *Marcus, Velma, or Alistair.*

You thought about the evidence. Marcus had motive (stealing books, financial troubles), opportunity (no verifiable alibi), and physical evidence (the silver button). Velma had an alibi (other customers saw her), and Alistair had an alibi (at an auction with witnesses).

*So it has to be Marcus,* you thought. *He's the only one with all three: motive, opportunity, and evidence.*

But you needed to be absolutely certain. You needed to make sure there wasn't anyone else involved, or anyone you'd missed.

What do you do?
