# Searching for Other Clothing Items That Might Match

You decided to search for other clothing items that might match the button, thinking you should be thorough before accusing anyone.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You looked around the shop, checking the clothing of everyone you'd seen. Velma was wearing a cashmere coat, but it didn't have buttons like the one you'd found. It had a different style, different buttons.

You asked Officer Martinez if there were any other customers in the shop, and she told you there had been a few, but they'd all left. "We got their contact information," she said. "But none of them were wearing anything with buttons like that."

*So it's probably from Marcus's cardigan,* you thought. *But I should be sure.*

You also thought about the position of the button. It had been found near Eleanor's desk, caught in the rug. *If it came from someone's clothing during a struggle,* you thought, *then that person was definitely in the office. And if it's from Marcus's cardigan, then Marcus was definitely in the office.*

You needed to compare the button to Marcus's cardigan directly, to be absolutely certain it matched.

What do you do?
