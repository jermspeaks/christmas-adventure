# Logical Approach

You took a step forward, gathering your thoughts. *I need to reason with them,* you thought. *I need to make a logical argument, to show them why they're wrong.*

"Logically speaking," you began, "if Christmas magic brings joy, even temporary joy, that's still valuable. And if the magic is locked away, people lose even that temporary joy. So by locking it away, you're causing more harm than good."

The guardian's expression didn't change. Their eyes remained cold, empty. "Logic doesn't account for disappointment," they said flatly. "Logic doesn't account for the pain of losing something you thought would last. Logic doesn't account for broken promises."

*Okay, that's a fair point,* you thought. *But I can counter that.*

"True," you said. "But logic also shows that without the magic, people lose the chance for joy entirely. And the potential for disappointment doesn't outweigh the certainty of loss."

The guardian was silent for a moment. "You're making logical arguments," they said. "But Christmas isn't logical. It's emotional. It's about feelings, about connection, about things that logic can't explain. You can't reason your way into understanding Christmas—you have to feel it."

*They're right,* you realized. *I'm trying to use logic, but Christmas isn't about logic. It's about emotion, about connection, about feeling. I need to show them, not tell them.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes gentle. "Logic has its place," they said. "But Christmas magic isn't logical. It's emotional. It's about connection, about feeling, about things that can't be reasoned. You need to show the guardian what Christmas means, not just explain it."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly. "The guardian needs to feel Christmas, not just understand it logically," it said. "They need to remember what it felt like, to experience the warmth, the joy, the connection. Logic alone won't reach them—they need emotion, they need feeling, they need connection."

*So I need to add emotion to my logic,* you thought. *I need to show them what Christmas means, not just explain it. I need to help them feel it, not just understand it.*
