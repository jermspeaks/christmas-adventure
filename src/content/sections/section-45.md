# Investigating Motives

*Why would someone kill Eleanor?* you thought. *What did they have to gain?*

You sat down with your notebook, trying to figure out the motives of each suspect. Yuzu watched you, his head tilted, as if he was trying to help you think.

*Let's start with Marcus,* you thought. *He works here. He's Eleanor's assistant manager. She was going to leave him the shop in her will, but only if certain conditions were met. What if she'd discovered something about him? What if she was going to fire him, or change her will?*

You thought about what you'd learned. Eleanor's journal entry: *Marcus is acting strange. I should talk to him.* And then: *The rare book collection. Someone knows. Someone's been asking questions.*

*What if Marcus had been stealing rare books?* you thought. *What if he'd been selling them without Eleanor's knowledge? And what if she'd found out?*

*Then there's Alistair Finch,* you thought. *The rare book dealer. He'd been trying to buy a collection from Eleanor for months, and she'd refused. He'd been sending threatening letters. But he had an alibi—he was at an auction in the city.*

*But what if he'd hired someone?* you thought. *What if he'd paid someone to kill Eleanor?*

*And Velma,* you thought. *She's a regular customer. She's been friends with Eleanor for twenty years. But what if there was something more? What if there was a secret, something that would give her a motive?*

You needed to investigate each of these possibilities. You needed to find out who had the strongest motive, who had the most to gain from Eleanor's death.

What do you do?
