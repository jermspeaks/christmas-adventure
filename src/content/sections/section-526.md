# The Pattern Reveals the Path

You'd been investigating the Keepsake Keeper from a different angle, studying its patterns, trying to understand what it was trying to tell you. But now, as you looked at it again, something clicked. The pattern wasn't just random—it was a map. A guide. A path.

*The light is showing me the way,* you realized. *The pulsing rhythm—it's pointing toward the Frostwood Forest.*

The Keepsake Keeper's voice, when it spoke, sounded both relieved and urgent. "You've seen it," it said. "The pattern I've been trying to show you. The trail of fading magic leads to the Frostwood Forest, where the Memory Vault is hidden. That's where all the stolen magic has been stored."

You looked at the ornament in your hands, its light pulsing in that same rhythm, and you understood. The investigation hadn't been a waste of time—it had revealed what you needed to know. The destination. The path. The urgency.

*I know where to go now,* you thought. *I know what I need to do.*

Cheshire trotted closer, their expression shifting from curiosity to determination. "You've learned what you needed," they said. "The Frostwood Forest. That's where we need to go. Are you ready?"

You nodded, feeling a new sense of purpose. The investigation had given you clarity, even if it had taken a different path than you'd expected. Now you knew where you were going, and why.

What do you do?
