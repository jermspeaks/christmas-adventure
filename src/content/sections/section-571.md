# Gentle Presence

You moved closer to Kvothe, your steps slow and careful, like approaching a wild animal that might bolt at any moment. *They need to know they're not alone,* you thought. *But they also need to know they can trust me.*

Kvothe didn't look up as you approached, but you saw their shoulders tense slightly, their hands clenching tighter. The emptiness around them felt heavy, like a weight pressing down on everything.

"Kvothe?" you said softly, settling down beside them, not too close, but close enough that they could feel your presence. "You don't have to be alone with this."

For a long moment, nothing happened. Then, slowly, Kvothe's shoulders relaxed just a fraction. Their hands unclenched. They didn't look at you, but you could feel something shift—the emptiness around them lessening, just a little.

*They're responding,* you realized. *They needed someone here, not space.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly in your hands, its light spreading gently, like a soft blanket. "Sometimes the hardest part of transformation is feeling like you're doing it alone," it said quietly. "But you're not alone. You never have to be."

Kvothe took a shaky breath, and you saw the first flicker of a memory—just a glimpse, like a candle flame in the dark. A child's laughter. A warm hand holding theirs. The scent of pine and cinnamon.

*They're starting to remember,* you thought, watching as more memories began to surface, slowly this time, gently, like bubbles rising in still water. *They just needed to know someone was there.*
