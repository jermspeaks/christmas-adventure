# Working with the Police

"I understand this is your investigation," you said to Officer Martinez. "But I've found evidence. I've put together a theory. And I think I could help. If you'd let me work with you, officially, I could assist with the verification. I know the shop, I know the people, I know the evidence I've found."

Officer Martinez considered this for a moment. "You've been very observant," she said. "And you've found things we might have missed. But this is a police investigation. There are procedures, protocols, things that need to be done a certain way."

"I understand," you said. "I'm not asking to take over. I'm asking to help. To work within your system. To follow your procedures. But to contribute what I've found, what I've observed."

Officer Martinez was quiet for a long moment. Then she nodded. "All right," she said. "I can work with that. But you need to understand—you'll be working under my direction. You'll follow my lead. You'll do things the way we need them done."

"I can do that," you said.

And so you did. You worked with Officer Martinez and her team, following their procedures, helping them verify the evidence you'd found. You helped gather handwriting samples. You helped trace the financial records. You helped document everything properly, the way it needed to be done for a court case.

It was different from working alone. Slower, more methodical, more careful. But it was also more thorough. More complete. More certain.

*This is how it should be done,* you thought. *Working together. Following procedures. Making sure everything is verified, everything is documented, everything is done right.*

Yuzu stayed close to you throughout, watching the process with those intelligent eyes. He seemed to understand that this was the right way, the proper way, to solve the case.

When everything was verified, when all the evidence was gathered and documented, Marcus was arrested. The case was solid. The evidence was overwhelming. Justice would be served.

*We did it together,* you thought. *The police and I. We worked as a team, and we solved it properly.*

The police investigation was complete. Marcus had been arrested and charged. The evidence was overwhelming, and justice would be served.

You'd done it. You'd solved the case. You'd found the truth.

But as you thought about everything that had happened, you realized that the story wasn't over yet. There were still questions to answer, still reflections to make, still consequences to face.
