# Overwhelming Everyone

You kept going, trying to explain everything, trying to make everyone understand all at once. *If I just explain it clearly enough,* you thought, *they'll get it. They have to get it.*

But the confusion only grew. People's faces became more blank, more overwhelmed. They were trying to follow along, but there was too much information, too many concepts, too much to understand all at once.

*They're not getting it,* you realized, frustration building. *I'm explaining everything, but they're not understanding. What am I doing wrong?*

You tried harder, explaining more, adding more details, trying to make it clearer. But the more you explained, the more confused people became. The magic was there, present and warm, but people didn't know how to connect with it, how to use it, how to understand it.

*This isn't working,* you thought, watching as people began to drift away, as they gave up trying to understand. *I'm making it worse, not better.*

Elara stepped forward, her expression kind but concerned. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm trying to understand, but there's just... so much. The magic is about connection? And memory? And emotion? And it's not about control? I don't... I don't know where to start."

*They need me to slow down,* you realized. *They need me to teach one thing at a time, not everything at once. But I've already overwhelmed them. I've already made it harder.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes gentle. "You're trying to help," they said. "But sometimes help means slowing down, not speeding up. Sometimes it means teaching one thing at a time, not everything at once. People need time to understand, to process, to learn."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly. "Understanding can't be rushed," it said. "When you try to teach everything at once, people become overwhelmed. They can't process it all. They need time, patience, small steps. You need to slow down, to teach one thing at a time."

*So I need to stop,* you thought. *I need to slow down, to start over, to teach in smaller pieces. But I've already overwhelmed everyone. Can I fix this?*

You looked at the confused faces, at the people who had given up, at the ones who were still trying but getting nowhere. *I made a mistake,* you realized. *But maybe I can fix it. Maybe I can slow down, start over, teach the right way.*

What do you do?
