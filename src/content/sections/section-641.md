# Timely Intervention

You stepped forward, moving into the crowd, helping people understand. *I can't wait anymore,* you thought. *They need help now, before things get worse.*

You found Elara, who was still struggling, her hands shaking with frustration. "Let me help you," you said gently. "The magic isn't about control anymore. It's about connection, about memory, about emotion. Think about a favorite Christmas memory, and feel the emotion. The magic will respond."

You guided her through it, step by step, helping her remember, helping her feel, helping her connect. And slowly, you saw understanding dawn in her eyes. The magic began to respond, flowing around her, warm and steady.

*It's working,* you thought, relief flooding through you. *She's understanding. She's connecting. The magic is responding.*

You moved to the next person, then the next, helping them understand, guiding them, showing them the way. And as you did, you saw the frustration beginning to fade, replaced by understanding, by connection, by joy.

*This is what they needed,* you realized. *They needed help, guidance, someone to show them the way. Waiting wasn't helping—intervening was.*

Cheshire trotted beside you, helping where they could, their presence calming. "You're helping," they said. "You're guiding, showing the way. That's what people needed—not waiting, but help, guidance, understanding."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Intervention at the right time can prevent problems from growing," it said. "When you help people understand before frustration becomes too great, you can guide them, show them the way, help them connect. That's what you're doing."

You looked around, at the people who were beginning to understand, at the way the magic was responding, at the way frustration was turning to joy. *This is working,* you thought. *By intervening now, I'm helping people understand before things get worse. I'm guiding them, showing them the way.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some people were still struggling, even with your help. Some were making progress, but others weren't. The problems weren't completely solved—they were just... smaller. More manageable.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some people need more help, more time, more guidance. How do we address all the problems?*

What do you do?
