# Narrowing the Field

You sat in the café area, surrounded by the warm glow of Christmas lights and the smell of old books, trying to make sense of everything. Yuzu had curled up at your feet, his head on your shoe, and you found yourself absently petting him as you thought.

*Let's start with what I know,* you told yourself. *Eleanor was killed in her office. The letter opener was hers, part of a set. The torn note mentioned "before Christmas Eve or else." She'd been receiving threats from Alistair Finch. She was planning to confront someone tonight. And someone was here, in the shop, when it happened.*

You pulled out Eleanor's journal again, reading through the entries more carefully this time. *Marcus is acting strange. I should talk to him.* And then, later: *The rare book collection. Someone knows. Someone's been asking questions.*

You thought about Marcus—his nervousness, his paper cut, the way he'd been so insistent about his alibi. *He was cataloging a first edition of The Maltese Falcon,* you remembered. *A book Eleanor had been trying to get for years.*

But wait. You'd seen the rare books section. It was pristine, organized, with each book carefully cataloged and displayed. If Marcus had been working there, there should have been signs of it—a catalog, notes, something. But when you'd looked, everything was already in its place, as if the work had been finished long ago.

*Unless he wasn't really working there,* you thought. *Unless that was just his alibi.*

You also thought about the silver button Yuzu had found. You'd been carrying it in your pocket, and now you pulled it out, examining it more closely. It was small, decorative, the kind of button you might find on a nice coat or a cardigan. You'd seen Velma wearing a cashmere coat, but you hadn't noticed if it had buttons like this.

But Marcus—Marcus had been wearing a cardigan, a nice one, dark gray with silver buttons. You'd noticed it earlier, when you'd first talked to him, because one of the buttons had been loose, the thread visible.

*Could it be?* You thought about the timeline. Marcus said he'd been in the rare books section. But what if he'd gone to Eleanor's office? What if they'd argued? What if he'd grabbed the letter opener in a moment of panic or anger?

You found Officer Martinez and told her your suspicions. She listened carefully, then nodded. "We've been looking into Marcus's background," she said. "Turns out he's been having financial troubles. And Eleanor's will leaves the bookshop to him, but only if certain conditions are met. Conditions that might not have been met if she'd discovered what he'd been doing."

"What had he been doing?" you asked.

"Selling rare books from the collection," Officer Martinez said. "Without Eleanor's knowledge. We found evidence of several sales over the past few months. If Eleanor had found out, she would have fired him, and he would have lost everything—his job, the inheritance, his reputation in the rare book community."

*So Marcus had motive,* you thought. *And opportunity. And the button could be the physical evidence that connected him to the scene.*

But something still nagged at you. The torn note. "Before Christmas Eve or else." That didn't sound like something Marcus would write. That sounded like a threat, like something Alistair Finch might have sent.

*Unless,* you thought, *Marcus had been working with Alistair. Or unless the note was a red herring, meant to throw suspicion elsewhere.*

You looked down at Yuzu, who was watching you with those bright, intelligent eyes. *What do you think, buddy?* you thought. *You found the first clue. What else are you trying to tell me?*

Yuzu stood up and trotted toward the office, then looked back at you, as if waiting for you to follow.

*Okay,* you thought. *Let's see what else you've found.*

What do you do?
