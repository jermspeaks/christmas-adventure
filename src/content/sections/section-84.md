# Verifying Financial Records

You focused on Marcus's financial records. If he'd been stealing rare books and selling them, there should be evidence in his bank accounts, his transactions, his financial history.

You asked Officer Martinez if you could help look into it. She was hesitant—financial records were sensitive, and you weren't officially part of the investigation. But she agreed to let you review what they'd already gathered, as long as you kept it confidential.

You spent hours going through the records. You found deposits that seemed suspicious—large amounts of money that appeared around the same time as rare book sales. You found transactions that didn't make sense for someone on Marcus's salary. You found patterns that suggested he'd been selling books without authorization.

*This is it,* you thought. *This proves it. Marcus was stealing books and selling them. He had motive. He had opportunity. He killed Eleanor to keep her from finding out.*

But as you looked deeper, you realized you couldn't verify everything. Some of the deposits could have been explained away. Some of the transactions might have had legitimate sources. You'd found enough to be suspicious, enough to point to Marcus, but you hadn't found the complete picture.

*I have enough,* you told yourself. *I have the financial records, the button, the note, the letter. That's enough.*

You presented your findings to Officer Martinez. She reviewed them carefully. "This is helpful," she said. "We'll investigate further, but this gives us a strong case."

A few days later, Marcus was arrested. The evidence you'd found was enough. The financial records, combined with the button, the note, and the letter, created a compelling case against him.

But you couldn't help thinking about the things you hadn't verified. The deposits you hadn't traced all the way back. The transactions you hadn't fully explained. The complete financial picture you hadn't uncovered.

*I solved it,* you thought. *But did I find everything?*

The truth had been found, as much of it as you could find. But you'd always wonder if there was more. If you'd missed some crucial detail. If you'd stopped investigating too soon.
