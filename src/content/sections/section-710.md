# Global Perspective

You stayed where you were, watching as the magic spread across the world. The streams of light flowed outward, reaching places you'd never been, touching lives you'd never known. You could see it happening—the magic reaching towns and cities, villages and homes, spreading like a gentle wave across the entire world.

*It's beautiful,* you thought, watching as the magic touched places far beyond Starlight Hollow. *It's reaching everywhere, bringing Christmas back to the whole world.*

But as you watched, you began to notice patterns. Some places were responding well—the magic settling in, bringing joy, creating connection. But other places were struggling. The magic was too strong in some areas, overwhelming everything. Too weak in others, barely touching them at all. And in some places, the magic seemed confused, uncertain, not knowing how to connect.

*The world is adjusting,* you realized. *But it's not adjusting evenly. Some places are doing well, others are struggling. The magic needs help finding balance, not just locally, but globally.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes thoughtful. "You're seeing the bigger picture," they said. "The magic is spreading everywhere, but it's not balanced. Some places are getting too much, others too little. The world needs help adjusting, not just in Starlight Hollow, but everywhere."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "The magic is global," it said. "It touches the whole world, not just one place. But the world has changed since the magic was locked away. Some places remember how to hold magic, others have forgotten. Some places need more, others need less. The magic needs guidance to find balance everywhere, not just locally."

*So I need to think globally,* you thought. *I need to understand how the magic is affecting the whole world, not just Starlight Hollow. I need to help it find balance everywhere.*

You looked out at the world, at the magic spreading, at the patterns you were seeing. *There's so much to understand,* you realized. *So many places, so many people, so many ways the magic needs to find balance.*

What do you do?
