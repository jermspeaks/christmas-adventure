# Checking if Velma's Story Matches the Evidence

You decided to check if Velma's story matched the evidence, thinking that would help you determine if she was telling the truth.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You compared Velma's story to the evidence. She said she found Eleanor around 3:30 or 4:00 PM. Eleanor's tea was still warm, which suggested she'd been killed recently, around that time.

Velma said she was in the mystery section the whole time, and other customers had seen her there. *So she has an alibi,* you thought.

Velma said she didn't see anyone else, didn't hear anything, didn't notice anything unusual. *But someone had to be there,* you thought. *Someone killed Eleanor.*

You also thought about the physical evidence. The silver button from Marcus's cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk. *That points to Marcus, not Velma,* you thought.

*So Velma's story seems to match the evidence,* you thought. *She has an alibi, and the physical evidence points to Marcus, not her.*

*But why didn't she call for help?* you wondered. *That's still suspicious.*

You needed to investigate more carefully, or focus on Marcus instead, since the evidence points to him.

What do you do?
