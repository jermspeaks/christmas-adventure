# Seeking Guidance

You turned to the Keepsake Keeper, asking for guidance. "I'm trying to redistribute the magic," you said. "But I don't know how. The magic needs to see connection, but I'm not sure how to show it. Can you guide me?"

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly, and you felt its wisdom, its guidance, flowing through you. "The magic needs to see connection," it said. "It needs to see that we're all working together, that we all care, that we all want to help. You can't do it alone—you need others. But you also need to show the magic that connection, that care, that help. Guide it, don't force it. Show it, don't control it."

*So I need help, but I also need to guide,* you thought. *I need to show the magic connection, care, help. I need to guide it, not force it.*

You took the guidance and began to work, but this time, you did it differently. You asked others to help, showing the magic that you were all connected, that you all cared, that you all wanted to help. But you also guided the magic, showing it where to go, helping it find balance, not forcing it.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as the magic began to respond, as it began to see the connection, as it began to find balance. *By seeking guidance, by working with others, by guiding instead of forcing, I'm helping the magic find balance.*

Cheshire trotted beside you, their eyes bright. "You're doing it right," they said. "You're seeking guidance, working with others, guiding instead of forcing. That's what the magic needs—connection, care, help, guidance. Not force, not control, but connection and guidance."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Guidance helps you help the magic," it said. "When you seek guidance, when you work with others, when you guide instead of force, you show the magic connection, care, help. That's what the magic needs to see, to feel, to respond to."

You looked around, at the way people were working together, at the way the magic was responding, at the way balance was being found. *This is working,* you thought. *By seeking guidance, by working with others, by guiding instead of forcing, I'm helping the magic find balance.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some magic streams were easy to guide, but others were more complex. Some places were simple to help, but others needed more time, more understanding, more work.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some magic streams need more help, more guidance, more time. How do we address all of them?*

What do you do?
