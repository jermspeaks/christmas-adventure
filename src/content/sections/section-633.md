# Seeking Help

You looked at the gathered crowd, at their confused faces, at their need for understanding. *I can't do this alone,* you realized. *I need help. I need others who understand to help me teach.*

You turned to Cheshire and the Keepsake Keeper. "I can't teach everyone alone," you said. "There are too many people, too much to understand. Can you help me? Can others who understand help me teach?"

Cheshire's eyes brightened, and they nodded. "Of course," they said. "Teaching is something we can do together. Those who understand can help those who are learning. That's how understanding spreads."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "You don't have to do this alone," it said. "There are others who understand—Cheshire, Kvothe, people who have learned. They can help you teach, help you spread understanding. Together, you can reach more people, help more people learn."

You looked around, and you saw it—people who had already learned, who understood, who could help. Elara had been practicing, and she was getting it. A few others had been working with the magic, and they understood it too.

*They can help,* you thought. *Together, we can teach everyone. We can spread understanding, help people learn, one person at a time, one group at a time.*

You gathered those who understood, and together, you began to teach. You worked in small groups, each person helping a few others, teaching one thing at a time, patiently, carefully. And as you did, you saw understanding spreading. People were learning, not just from you, but from each other.

*This is working,* you realized. *Together, we're teaching. Together, we're spreading understanding. This is how it should be done.*

Cheshire trotted between groups, helping where needed, their presence calming and supportive. "This is how understanding spreads," they said. "Not from one person to everyone, but from person to person, group to group, connection to connection."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "You're learning," it said. "You don't have to do everything alone. Together, you can reach more people, help more people understand. That's the power of connection, of working together."

You looked at the groups, at the way understanding was spreading, at the way people were learning from each other. *This is better,* you thought. *This is how it should be. Together, we're teaching. Together, we're learning. Together, we're understanding.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some people were still struggling, even with help. Some groups were making progress, but others weren't. The understanding was spreading, but not evenly, not completely.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still people who need more help, more time, more guidance. How do we reach everyone?*

What do you do?
