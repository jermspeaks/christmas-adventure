# Unprepared

You entered the Frostwood Forest completely unprepared, without supplies, without knowledge, without caution. You thought you could handle whatever you found, that preparation wasn't necessary.

*I don't need supplies,* you thought. *I can handle this.*

But the Frostwood Forest was dangerous, especially now that the magic was fading. Without supplies, you quickly found yourself in trouble. Without knowledge, you made mistakes. Without caution, you put yourself in danger.

*This is worse than I thought,* you realized, but it was too late.

You became lost in the forest, unable to find your way, unable to help. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever. You were left lost, alone, unable to make a difference.

*I should have prepared,* you thought. *I should have gathered supplies, learned more, been more careful.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that preparation is essential, that supplies matter, that caution is not cowardice.
