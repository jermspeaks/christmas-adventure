# Searching for More Evidence

You went back through the shop, looking for anything else that might confirm your theory. You searched Marcus's workspace. You looked through more of Eleanor's files. You checked the rare books section again, looking for any signs of missing books or tampering.

But you were running out of time. The police were wrapping up their investigation. They were going to make a decision soon, and you wanted to make sure you had everything before they did.

You found a few more things—a receipt that might have been from a rare book sale, a note in Marcus's handwriting that seemed suspicious, some financial records that showed unusual deposits. But you couldn't verify everything. You couldn't be absolutely certain.

*I have enough,* you thought. *I have the button, the note, the letter, Eleanor's journal. That's enough to prove Marcus did it.*

But was it? You kept thinking about the things you hadn't checked. The handwriting analysis—you'd compared it yourself, but you hadn't had it professionally verified. The financial records—you'd seen some deposits, but you hadn't traced them all the way back. The button—you were certain it came from Marcus's cardigan, but you hadn't had it tested.

*But I have enough,* you told yourself. *I've found the truth. I've solved the case.*

You went to Officer Martinez and presented what you'd found. She listened carefully, taking notes. "This is good work," she said. "We'll verify everything, but this gives us a strong direction."

A few days later, Marcus was arrested. The evidence you'd found was enough. The button, the note, the letter, Eleanor's journal—it all pointed to him, and the police were able to verify enough of it to make the arrest.

But as the case moved forward, as the trial approached, you couldn't help thinking about the things you hadn't found. The details you'd missed. The questions you hadn't asked. The evidence you hadn't verified completely.

*I solved it,* you thought. *But did I solve it completely?*

The truth had been found, as much of it as you could find. But you'd always wonder if there was more. If you'd missed something important. If you'd stopped looking too soon.
