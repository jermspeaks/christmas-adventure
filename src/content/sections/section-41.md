# Interviewing Marcus

Marcus Chen looked pale and shaken, his hands trembling as he sat across from you at one of the café tables. Yuzu had curled up at your feet, watching Marcus with those bright, intelligent eyes.

"I can't believe this," Marcus kept saying. "Eleanor was... she was like family. Who would do this?"

You studied him carefully. He was young, maybe in his mid-twenties, with dark hair and nervous eyes. He wore a nice cardigan—dark gray with silver buttons. You noticed one of the buttons was loose, the thread visible.

*Interesting,* you thought.

"I need to ask you some questions," you said, trying to sound more confident than you felt. "You said you were in the rare books section when it happened?"

"Yes," Marcus said, his voice a bit too quick. "I was cataloging a new acquisition. A first edition of *The Maltese Falcon*. Eleanor was excited about it. She'd been trying to get it for years."

*The rare book collection,* you thought, remembering what you'd learned. *Someone knows. Someone's been asking questions.*

"How long were you there?" you asked.

"All afternoon," Marcus said. "I have the catalog to prove it. I was working on it, making notes, organizing everything. I didn't leave until... until I heard the commotion."

*But you saw the rare books section,* you thought. *It was pristine, organized, with each book carefully cataloged and displayed. If Marcus had been working there, there should have been signs of it—a catalog, notes, something. But when you'd looked, everything was already in its place, as if the work had been finished long ago.*

*Unless he wasn't really working there,* you thought. *Unless that was just his alibi.*

You also noticed something else. Marcus had a fresh paper cut on his thumb. Small, but visible. *How did he get that?* you wondered. *From cataloging books? Or from something else?*

"What was your relationship with Eleanor like?" you asked.

Marcus's face tightened. "She was my boss," he said. "But more than that. She was a mentor. She taught me everything I know about rare books. She was going to leave me the shop, you know. In her will. She told me that."

*Interesting,* you thought. *So Marcus had something to gain from Eleanor's death. But only if certain conditions were met. Conditions that might not have been met if she'd discovered what he'd been doing.*

What do you do?
