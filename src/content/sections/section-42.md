# Interviewing Velma

Velma Ousley sat across from you, her posture perfect, her expression carefully controlled. She was in her sixties, with perfectly styled gray hair and a cashmere coat that probably cost more than your entire wardrobe. But despite her composure, you could see the tension in her shoulders, the way her hands gripped her purse.

"I saw Eleanor earlier," Velma said, her voice crisp and precise. "She seemed perfectly fine. A bit stressed, perhaps, but that's normal this time of year."

Yuzu was watching her, his head tilted, as if he was trying to figure her out. *Good dog,* you thought.

"You said you were in the mystery section the whole time?" you asked.

"Yes," Velma said. "I've been here for over an hour, looking for a gift for our book club's Christmas exchange. I was browsing, taking my time. I didn't see or hear anything unusual."

*But you saw her slip something into her purse,* you thought. *Earlier, when she thought no one was looking. Something small and rectangular.*

"I saw you take something," you said, trying to sound more confident than you felt. "Earlier, when you thought no one was looking."

Velma's face flushed, and for a moment, you thought you'd caught her. But then she reached into her purse and pulled out a small, leather-bound book—a first edition of *Murder on the Orient Express*, its cover worn but clearly valuable.

"I was going to pay for it," she said, her voice defensive. "I always do. Eleanor knew I sometimes... borrow books to examine them more closely before purchasing. It's a habit, I know, but I always bring them back or pay for them. I have the receipt right here."

She showed you a receipt, dated that morning, for the exact book she was holding. *Well, that's embarrassing,* you thought. *So much for my detective skills.*

But Velma wasn't done. "I know what you're thinking," she said, her tone sharper now. "But I had nothing to do with Eleanor's death. She was my friend. We've known each other for twenty years. I was here looking for a gift for our book club's Christmas exchange, and I found her like that, just like you did."

*Wait,* you thought. *She found Eleanor? But she said she was in the mystery section the whole time.*

You asked her about it, and Velma's composure cracked slightly. "I... I went to the office to ask Eleanor about a book. I found her there. I panicked. I didn't know what to do, so I went back to browsing, trying to process what I'd seen. I know it sounds terrible, but I was in shock."

*That could be true,* you thought. *Or it could be a lie.*

What do you do?
