# Looking for Evidence Alistair Was Involved

You decided to look for evidence that Alistair was involved in the murder, thinking he might have hired someone or worked with someone else.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez if there was any evidence that Alistair had hired someone or worked with someone else, and she shook her head. "We've looked into that," she said. "There's no evidence of that. Alistair has a solid alibi, and there's no indication that he hired anyone or worked with anyone else."

*So he probably wasn't involved,* you thought. *He has an alibi, and there's no evidence he hired anyone.*

You also thought about the torn note. The one that said "before Christmas Eve or else..." The handwriting didn't match Alistair's, which suggested someone else had written it. *Maybe Marcus wrote it,* you thought. *Maybe Marcus was trying to frame Alistair.*

You also thought about the letter from Alistair. The one saying he could prove Marcus was stealing. *If Alistair was going to expose Marcus, and Marcus found out, then Marcus might have killed Eleanor to keep her from finding out the truth,* you thought.

*So it's probably just Marcus,* you thought. *Alistair has an alibi, and there's no evidence he was involved. Marcus is the one with motive, opportunity, and evidence.*

You needed to focus on Marcus, and gather more evidence against him.

What do you do?
