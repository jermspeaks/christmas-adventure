# Ignored Tree Warnings

You completely ignored the tree warnings, thinking they were just noise, that you didn't need to listen. You pushed forward, ignoring their whispers, their concern, their guidance.

*I don't need to listen to trees,* you thought. *They're just trees.*

But the trees were trying to warn you. The path ahead was dangerous, and without heeding their warnings, you quickly found yourself in trouble. You went the wrong way, you encountered dangers you weren't prepared for, you put yourself at risk.

*This is worse than I thought,* you realized, but it was too late.

The trees fell silent, unable to help you anymore. You became lost, unable to find the Memory Vault, unable to help. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever.

*I should have listened,* you thought. *I should have heeded the tree warnings.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that warnings come from unexpected places, that listening is essential, that nature has wisdom to share.
