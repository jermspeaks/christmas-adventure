# Looking for Evidence of Missing Books

You decided to look for evidence of missing books, thinking that would help you prove Marcus had been stealing.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez if there was evidence of missing books, and she nodded. "We found discrepancies in the inventory," she said. "Several rare books that should have been in the collection are missing. And we found records of sales—books that were sold to dealers, including Alistair Finch, with the money going into Marcus's account."

*So there's definitely evidence of missing books,* you thought. *And Marcus was selling them.*

You also thought about Eleanor's journal entry: *December 18th: Another book missing. I need to check the inventory.*

*So she'd noticed books were missing,* you thought. *She was checking the inventory. And she was going to confront Marcus about it.*

*So Marcus had been stealing books,* you thought. *Eleanor had discovered it. And he killed her to keep her from exposing him.*

You needed to check the inventory records yourself, or present all this evidence to Officer Martinez.

What do you do?
