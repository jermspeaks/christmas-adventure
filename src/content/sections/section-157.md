# Overwhelming Memories

Kvothe's memories began to flood back, and you could see them struggling to process it all. Images flickered around them—a child placing a star on a tree, a mother singing carols, a father laughing. The warmth of family, the joy of Christmas, the pain of loss. It was all there, all at once, and it was too much.

*They're drowning in it,* you realized. *All these memories, all these feelings, coming back at once. They need to process this slowly, not all at once.*

"Kvothe," you said gently, "you don't have to remember everything right now. You don't have to process it all at once. Take your time. One memory at a time. One feeling at a time."

Kvothe looked at you, their eyes wide with overwhelm. "But it's all there," they said. "All of it. The good and the bad. The joy and the pain. I remember my family, and I remember losing them. I remember loving Christmas, and I remember watching the magic fade. It's all there, and I don't know how to hold it all."

The Keepsake Keeper's light pulsed softly, and you felt its warmth spreading, calming. "Memories are meant to be held gently," it said. "Not all at once, but one at a time. Like ornaments on a tree—each one beautiful on its own, but together, they create something magical."

You reached out and took Kvothe's hand, and you could feel their warmth, their humanity. "Let's start with one memory," you said. "One good memory. The one that makes you smile. Can you find that one?"

Kvothe closed their eyes, and you watched as their expression shifted, as they searched through the flood of memories. Slowly, a smile began to form on their face. "I remember my mother singing," they said. "She had the most beautiful voice. She would sing carols while we decorated the tree, and I would try to sing along, even though I didn't know all the words."

*That's it,* you thought. *That's a good place to start. One memory, one feeling, one moment of joy.*
