# Wise Counsel

You turned to Cheshire and the Keepsake Keeper, feeling their wisdom, their understanding. "I don't know what to do," you said. "People are struggling, and I don't know how to help them. What should I do?"

Cheshire's eyes were gentle, thoughtful. "The people need guidance," they said. "But guidance doesn't mean doing everything for them. It means showing them the way, helping them understand, supporting them as they learn. You can't make them understand—you can only help them find understanding themselves."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Intervention is important," it said. "But the best intervention is gentle, patient, supportive. Help people understand one thing at a time. Guide them, don't control them. Show them the way, don't force them down it. They need to learn, to grow, to understand—and you can help them do that."

*So I need to help, but gently,* you thought. *I need to guide, not control. I need to show the way, not force it.*

You took their advice and moved forward, but this time, you did it differently. You didn't try to fix everything at once. You didn't try to control how people learned. You just... helped. You guided, you showed, you supported.

You found Elara, who was still struggling, and you helped her gently, patiently, showing her one thing at a time, supporting her as she learned. And slowly, you saw understanding begin to grow.

*This is working,* you realized. *By following their advice, by helping gently, by guiding instead of controlling, I'm actually helping people understand.*

Cheshire trotted beside you, their eyes bright. "You're doing it right," they said. "You're helping, but gently. You're guiding, not controlling. That's what people need—support, not force. Guidance, not control."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Wise counsel helps you help others," it said. "When you listen, when you learn, when you apply what you've learned, you can help people in the right way. You're doing that now—helping gently, guiding patiently, supporting as people learn."

You looked around, at the people you were helping, at the way understanding was beginning to grow. *This is better,* you thought. *By seeking advice, by listening, by helping gently, I'm actually making progress. People are learning, understanding, growing.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some people were still struggling, even with gentle help. Some were making progress, but others needed more support, more time, more guidance.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some people need more help, more patience, more understanding. How do we address all the problems?*

What do you do?
