# The Village Baker

The villager who had spoken to you introduced themselves as Elara, the village baker. "I make the magical pastries," they explained, leading you toward a cozy cottage with a sign that read "Elara's Enchanted Bakery" in cheerful, hand-painted letters. "Or at least, I used to. Lately, nothing I bake has that special sparkle. The gingerbread men don't dance anymore. The sugar cookies don't sing. It's very disappointing."

*Gingerbread men that dance?* you thought. *I need to see this when the magic is restored.*

Elara's cottage smelled of cinnamon, vanilla, and something else—something that should have been magical but wasn't quite. The kitchen was warm and inviting, with copper pots hanging from the ceiling and a large wooden table covered in flour. A gingerbread house sat on the counter, but even from across the room, you could see it looked... flat. Like a regular gingerbread house, not a magical one.

"Have a seat," Elara said, gesturing to a chair by the fireplace. "I'll make us some cocoa. It won't be as good as it used to be, but it's still warm."

Cheshire settled by the fire, their tail swishing. "Elara knows more about the magic than most," they explained. "They've been studying it for years, trying to understand how it works."

Elara returned with three mugs of cocoa—one for you, one for themselves, and one tiny one for Cheshire, which you found both adorable and slightly concerning. (How did Cheshire drink from a mug? You decided not to ask.)

"The magic has always been here," Elara said, settling into a chair. "It flows through everything—the snow, the lights, the decorations, even the food. But about three weeks ago, we started noticing it was fading. At first, it was small things. A light that wouldn't stay lit. A decoration that lost its sparkle. But then the Keepsake Keepers started disappearing."

They took a sip of cocoa, their expression thoughtful. "The Keepsake Keepers are special. They're not just ornaments—they're guardians. Each one holds a piece of the world's Christmas magic, and they're supposed to protect it, keep it safe. But someone's been taking them, draining their magic, and storing it somewhere."

"The Memory Vault," you said, remembering what the Keepsake Keeper had told you.

Elara nodded. "That's what we think. But no one knows where it is, or who built it. All we know is that the magic is being pulled toward the Frostwood Forest. That's where it's strongest—the pull, I mean. Like a magnet."

*So the forest is definitely where we need to go,* you thought. *But maybe with a bit more information first.*

What do you do?
