# Power Demonstration

You held up the Keepsake Keeper, feeling its power, its light. *I'll show them,* you thought. *I'll demonstrate what the magic can do, prove its power, prove its worth.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light brightened, filling the clearing with warm, golden light. The frost on the ground began to sparkle. The carvings on the archway started to glow. The magic was there, present, powerful.

*See?* you thought. *This is what the magic can do. This is its power.*

But the guardian's expression didn't change. Their eyes remained cold, empty. "Power," they said flatly. "You're showing me power. But Christmas isn't about power. It's about connection, about feeling, about things that power can't create. You can't force someone to feel Christmas spirit—you can only show them, share it with them."

*They're right,* you realized. *I'm showing them power, but Christmas isn't about power. It's about connection, about emotion, about feeling. The power is just a tool—it's not the point.*

You looked at the Keepsake Keeper, at its light, at its warmth. *The power is there,* you thought. *But it's not enough. I need to show them the spirit behind it, the connection, the feeling. I need to show them what Christmas really means.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes gentle. "Power is impressive," they said. "But Christmas magic isn't about power—it's about connection, about feeling, about sharing. You need to show the guardian what Christmas means, not just what the magic can do."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly. "The magic has power," it said. "But that power comes from connection, from emotion, from feeling. The guardian needs to understand that, to feel that, not just see the power. They need to experience the spirit behind it."

*So I need to show them the spirit, not just the power,* you thought. *I need to help them feel what Christmas means, not just see what the magic can do.*

What do you do?
