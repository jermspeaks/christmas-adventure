# Given Up

You decided to give up, to let the magic sort itself out, to stop trying to help. You were tired, frustrated, and you just wanted to stop. You walked away.

*I can't do this anymore,* you thought. *I'm giving up.*

But giving up only made things worse. The magic became permanently unstable, unable to find balance, unable to work properly. Everything fell apart.

*I gave up,* you realized. *I lost everything.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You gave up," it said, its voice sad. "You stopped trying, but magic needs guidance. Without it, it became permanently unstable, unable to find balance. Everything fell apart."

*I gave up,* you realized. *I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains unstable—permanently, a reminder that giving up is not the answer, that persistence is more important than giving up.
