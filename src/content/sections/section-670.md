# Missed Insights

You pushed the reflection away, focusing only on the celebration, on the joy, on the moment. *I don't need to reflect,* you thought. *Everything is fine. The celebration is joyful. What more do I need?*

But as time passed, you began to notice problems. Small ones at first—people struggling with the magic, places where things weren't quite balanced, connections that seemed fragile. But they were growing, becoming bigger, more urgent.

*These problems are getting worse,* you realized, watching as confusion turned to frustration, as small issues became bigger ones. *Maybe I should have reflected. Maybe I would have seen this coming.*

You saw Elara trying to help someone understand the magic, her expression worried. "I don't understand why this is happening," she said. "The magic was working, but now people are struggling. What changed?"

*I don't know,* you thought. *I didn't reflect. I didn't think about what might happen, what challenges might arise. I just focused on the celebration, and now I'm not prepared.*

Cheshire trotted over to you, their eyes gentle but concerned. "Reflection isn't just about looking back," they said. "It's about understanding, about learning, about preparing. When you reflect, you see patterns, you understand challenges, you prepare for what might come. When you don't reflect, you miss those insights, and problems catch you unprepared."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "Reflection helps you understand," it said. "It helps you see what you've learned, what challenges might arise, what you need to prepare for. When you skip reflection, you miss those insights, and problems can catch you by surprise."

*So I should have reflected,* you thought. *I should have taken the time to understand, to learn, to prepare. Now I'm catching up, trying to understand problems I might have seen coming if I'd reflected.*

You looked around, at the problems that were growing, at the challenges that were emerging. *Maybe it's not too late,* you thought. *Maybe I can still reflect, still understand, still prepare.*

What do you do?
