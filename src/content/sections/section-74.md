# Showing the Button to Velma

You decided to show the button to Velma, thinking she might recognize it or know where it came from.

Yuzu stayed close, watching Velma carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

You pulled out the silver button, holding it carefully. "Do you recognize this?" you asked.

Velma examined it closely, her expression thoughtful. "It looks like a button from a cardigan," she said. "Or maybe a coat. But I don't recognize it specifically. Where did you find it?"

"Near Eleanor's desk," you said. "It was caught in the rug."

Velma's face went pale. "Oh. So it was... it was there when..."

*When Eleanor was killed,* you thought. *Yes.*

"I don't recognize it," Velma said. "But I saw Marcus wearing a cardigan earlier. A dark gray one with silver buttons. Could it be from that?"

*So she noticed Marcus's cardigan too,* you thought. *Interesting.*

"You noticed his cardigan?" you asked.

Velma nodded. "Yes. I saw him earlier, when I first arrived. He was wearing a dark gray cardigan with silver buttons. One of the buttons looked loose, like it might fall off."

*So she noticed the loose button,* you thought. *That's interesting. But does that mean she's involved, or just observant?*

You needed to investigate more carefully. You needed to compare the button to Marcus's cardigan, and see if it really matched.

What do you do?
