# Investigating Alistair Finch

Alistair Finch. The rare book dealer whose business card Yuzu had found. The man who'd been trying to buy a rare collection from Eleanor for months, and who'd been sending threatening letters when she refused.

*But he had an alibi,* you thought. *He was at an auction in the city, with dozens of witnesses.*

*Or was he?* you wondered.

You looked at the letter you'd found in Eleanor's filing cabinet. It was from Alistair, dated December 20th, just two days ago. *Eleanor,* it read. *I know what Marcus has been doing. I can prove he's been stealing from your collection. Meet me tonight, and I'll give you all the evidence. But you have to act before Christmas Eve, or I'll take it to the authorities myself.*

*So Alistair wasn't threatening Eleanor,* you thought. *He was trying to help her. He was going to give her evidence against Marcus.*

*But then why the torn note?* you wondered. *The one that said "before Christmas Eve or else..." That sounded like a threat. And the handwriting was different from Alistair's.*

*Unless someone else wrote it,* you thought. *Unless someone was trying to make it look like Alistair was the bad guy.*

You thought about the timeline. Alistair's letter was dated December 20th. The torn note was more recent. *What if Marcus had intercepted Alistair's letter?* you wondered. *What if he'd found out that Alistair was going to expose him? And what if he'd written a fake threatening note to make it look like Alistair was the one threatening Eleanor?*

*That would explain a lot,* you thought. *But I need to verify Alistair's alibi. I need to make sure he really was at that auction.*

What do you do?
