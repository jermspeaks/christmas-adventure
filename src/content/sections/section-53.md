# Pressing Marcus on His Alibi

You pressed Marcus harder, asking him to explain exactly what he'd been doing in the rare books section. "Show me the catalog you were working on," you said. "Show me your notes. Prove that you were really here."

Marcus's face tightened. "I... I finished it. I put everything away. That's how I work—I clean up as I go."

*But that doesn't make sense,* you thought. *If you were cataloging a new acquisition, there should be evidence of that. Notes, a catalog entry, something.*

"You said you were working on a first edition of *The Maltese Falcon*," you said. "Show me the book. Show me where it is."

Marcus led you to the rare books section, and sure enough, there was a first edition of *The Maltese Falcon* on display. But it looked like it had been there for a while—it was already cataloged, already in its place, with a price tag and everything.

*This doesn't look like a new acquisition,* you thought. *This looks like it's been here for a while.*

"Marcus," you said, "this book looks like it's been here for a while. It's already cataloged. It's already priced. When did you actually work on it?"

Marcus's face went pale. "I... I don't remember exactly. Earlier today. This morning, maybe."

*But you said you were working on it this afternoon,* you thought. *When Eleanor was killed.*

You were getting somewhere. Marcus's alibi was falling apart. But you needed more. You needed proof.

What do you do?
