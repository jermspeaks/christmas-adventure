# Controlled Magic

You decided to try to control how the community uses the magic, to make them use it your way, to be in charge. You thought you knew what was best, that you should control it. You tried to control it.

*I know what's best,* you thought. *I should control it.*

But trying to control the magic only made it resist, rebel, reject you. The magic lost its connection power, and everything fell apart.

*The magic is resisting,* you thought. *It's losing power.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You tried to control the magic," it said, its voice sad. "But magic requires freedom, connection, sharing. You tried to control it, and it resisted, losing its connection power. Everything fell apart."

*I tried to control it,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains weakened—resisting, connection lost, a reminder that control is not the answer, that freedom is more important than control.
