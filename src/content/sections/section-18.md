# A Clearing in the Forest

The path through the forest led you to a clearing—a small, circular space where the trees parted to reveal a patch of sky above. But this wasn't an ordinary clearing. The ground here was covered in what looked like frost, but it wasn't cold. Instead, it shimmered with a faint, silvery light that seemed to pulse in time with your heartbeat.

*Okay, that's definitely magical,* you thought. *And also slightly concerning.*

In the center of the clearing stood a structure that made your breath catch. It was a small, stone archway, covered in intricate carvings that seemed to shift and change as you looked at them. The carvings showed scenes of Christmas—trees being decorated, gifts being given, families coming together. But as you watched, the scenes began to fade, the carvings growing dimmer, as if the magic that animated them was being drained away.

"The Memory Vault," the Keepsake Keeper whispered, its voice filled with awe and sadness. "This is it. This is where all the magic has been stored. But it's... it's not right. The vault was never meant to be a prison. It was supposed to be a place of safekeeping, a way to preserve magic during times of need. But someone has locked it, sealed it away so the magic can't escape."

You stepped closer, and immediately, you felt a wave of... something. Not cold, exactly, but emptiness. Like all the joy and wonder had been sucked out of the air. The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed significantly, and you had to hold it tighter to keep it from going out completely.

*This is the source,* you realized. *This is where all the magic is being kept. And it's wrong. It's all wrong.*

Cheshire stayed at the edge of the clearing, their fur standing on end. "I can't go any closer," they said, their voice strained. "The emptiness... it's too strong. It's draining what little magic I have left."

You looked at the archway, at the fading carvings, at the way the world around it felt so empty. *This is it. This is what we came to find. But how do we fix it? How do we release the magic?*

The Keepsake Keeper's light flickered. "The vault can only be opened by someone with genuine Christmas spirit," it said. "Joy, wonder, the desire to give rather than take. That's why you can see it when others can't. But opening it... that will require more than just seeing it. You'll need to truly understand what Christmas magic means."

*Great,* you thought. *No pressure.*

What do you do?
