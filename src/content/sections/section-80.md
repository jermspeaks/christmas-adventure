# Rushing to Confrontation

You laid everything out on the table between you and Marcus—the silver button, the torn note, Alistair's letter, Eleanor's journal. You were so certain, so confident in your theory, that you didn't stop to think about what you were doing.

"I have all the evidence," you said, your voice firm. "The button from your cardigan. The note you wrote. The letter that proves you were stealing. Eleanor's journal that shows she was going to confront you. It all points to you, Marcus. You killed her."

Marcus's face went pale, but he didn't break. Instead, he looked at you with something that might have been anger, or might have been fear. "You don't know what you're talking about," he said. "You're jumping to conclusions. You haven't verified any of this."

*But I'm right,* you thought. *I know I'm right. All the evidence points to him.*

But as you pressed forward, as you accused him more forcefully, you realized you'd made a mistake. You'd been so eager to solve the case, so certain of your theory, that you'd accused him publicly, in front of everyone in the shop. Velma was watching, her expression shocked. Other customers had stopped to listen. Yuzu was whining softly, as if he knew something was wrong.

"You're wrong," Marcus said, his voice shaking. "You're wrong about everything. I didn't kill Eleanor. I loved her. She was like a mother to me."

*But the evidence—* you started to think, but then you stopped. Because you realized you hadn't actually verified the handwriting. You hadn't confirmed the button came from his cardigan. You hadn't checked his financial records. You'd just assumed, based on what seemed like obvious connections.

Officer Martinez appeared, her expression stern. "What's going on here?" she asked.

You tried to explain, but as you did, you realized how flimsy your evidence actually was. How much you'd assumed. How much you'd jumped to conclusions.

"I need to speak with you," Officer Martinez said to you, her tone leaving no room for argument. "Privately."

As you followed her away, you saw the damage you'd done. Marcus was shaken, his reputation damaged. Velma looked at you with something that might have been disappointment. And Yuzu—Yuzu was watching you with those intelligent eyes, as if he knew you'd made a mistake.

*I was so sure,* you thought. *But I rushed. I didn't verify. I didn't check. I just assumed.*

Later, after the police had done their own investigation, after they'd verified the evidence properly, Marcus was arrested. You'd been right about him, in the end. But you'd been wrong about how to handle it. You'd hurt people in the process. You'd damaged reputations. You'd created problems that wouldn't have existed if you'd been more careful.

The truth had been found, but at a cost.
