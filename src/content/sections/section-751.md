# Asking for Help

You realized you couldn't do it alone and turned to the others. "I need help," you said. "I'm trying to redistribute the magic, to help it find balance, but I can't do it alone. The magic needs to see connection, to see that we're all working together, that we all care. Can others join me?"

Cheshire's eyes brightened, and they nodded. "Of course," they said. "We can help. Together, we can show the magic that we're all connected, that we all care, that we all want to help. Together, we can help the magic find balance."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Asking for help is important," it said. "When you realize you can't do something alone, when you ask others to help, you show the magic that we're all connected, that we all care, that we all want to help. That connection, that care, that help, is what the magic needs to see."

You looked around, and you saw it—people who were willing to help, who wanted to support, who cared about helping the magic find balance. Together, you began to work, channeling the Keepsake Keeper's power, showing the magic that you were all connected, that you all cared, that you all wanted to help.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as the magic began to respond, as it began to see the connection, as it began to find balance. *By asking for help, by working together, I'm showing the magic that we're all connected, that we all care, that we all want to help.*

Cheshire trotted between groups, helping where needed, their presence supportive. "This is how it should be done," they said. "Together, showing the magic that we're all connected, that we all care, that we all want to help. When you ask for help and work together, the magic responds, finds balance, creates connection."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Connection creates balance," it said. "When you ask for help, when you work together, when you show the magic that we're all connected, the magic responds, finds balance, creates connection. That's what you're doing now."

You looked around, at the way people were working together, at the way the magic was responding, at the way balance was being found. *This is working,* you thought. *By asking for help, by working together, I'm showing the magic that we're all connected, that we all care, that we all want to help.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some magic streams were easy to guide, but others were more complex. Some places were simple to help, but others needed more time, more understanding, more work.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some magic streams need more help, more guidance, more time. How do we address all of them?*

What do you do?
