# Using Understanding for Transformation

You used the deeper understanding you'd gained to help Kvothe's transformation. "You understand now," you said. "You understand why you locked the magic away, why you were trying to protect people. But you also understand that you were protecting them from joy, not just from disappointment. That understanding can help you transform, help you become the guardian of balanced magic you're meant to be."

You worked with Kvothe, using the understanding to guide the transformation, to help them see who they could become, what their role could be. And as you did, you saw the transformation deepening, becoming more complete, more genuine.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as Kvothe transformed, as they became more themselves, more the guardian of balanced magic they were meant to be. *By using the deeper understanding, I'm helping the transformation, making it more complete, more genuine.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes bright. "Understanding helps transformation," they said. "When you use deeper understanding to help someone transform, you help them become who they're meant to be, help them find their true role, help them grow into their purpose."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Understanding creates transformation," it said. "When you use deeper understanding to help transformation, you help someone become who they're meant to be, help them find their true role, help them grow. That's what you're doing now."

You looked at Kvothe, at the way they were transforming, at the way they were becoming the guardian of balanced magic they were meant to be. *This is working,* you thought. *By using the deeper understanding, I'm helping the transformation, making it more complete, more genuine.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Transformation was still hard, still slow, still complex. Some parts were easier, but others needed more time, more understanding, more work.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Transformation is hard, slow, complex. How do we help them through it?*

What do you do?
