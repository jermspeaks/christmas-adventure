# Opportunity Based on Timing

You analyzed the timeline, trying to figure out who had the opportunity to kill Eleanor based on when she was killed.

*If Eleanor was killed around 4:00 PM,* you thought, *then who was where at that time?*

Marcus said he'd been in the rare books section all afternoon, working on a catalog. But there was no evidence of that work. No catalog, no notes, nothing. *So where was he really?* you wondered.

Velma said she'd been in the mystery section the whole time, browsing. Other customers had seen her there. *So she has an alibi,* you thought.

*But Marcus doesn't have a verifiable alibi,* you thought. *He says he was working, but there's no evidence of that. He could have been anywhere. He could have been in Eleanor's office.*

You also thought about the silver button Yuzu had found. It was near Eleanor's desk, caught in the rug. *If that button came from Marcus's cardigan, and it was found near the scene, then Marcus was definitely in the office,* you thought.

*So Marcus had opportunity,* you thought. *He was here, he could have been in the office, and he doesn't have a verifiable alibi.*

But you needed to be sure. You needed to verify the timeline, verify where everyone was, verify who had the opportunity.

*I need to focus on Marcus,* you thought. *He's the one with the most opportunity, the most motive, and the most evidence against him.*

What do you do?
