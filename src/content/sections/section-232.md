# Control Over Others

You decided to try to use your mastery to control others, to make them do what you wanted, to be in charge. You thought you could use the magic to control people, that you knew what was best. You tried to control them.

*I can control them,* you thought. *I know what's best.*

But using magic to control others only made them resist, rebel, reject you. The magic rejected you too, cutting you off, locking you out. You lost everything.

*They're resisting,* you thought. *The magic is rejecting me.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light died. "You tried to control others," it said, its voice fading. "But magic is about connection, sharing, togetherness. It cannot be used to control. You tried, and everyone rejected you, the magic rejected you. You lost everything."

*I tried to control them,* you realized. *I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but you remain alone—rejected by everyone, rejected by magic, a reminder that control is not the answer, that connection is more important than control.
