# Checking if the Book Is Actually Valuable

You decided to check if the book Velma had taken was actually valuable, thinking that might reveal something about her motive.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You examined the book more carefully. It was a first edition of *Murder on the Orient Express*, leather-bound, clearly valuable. But was it valuable enough to be a motive for murder? Probably not.

*Unless there was something hidden in it,* you thought. *A note, a clue, something important.*

You flipped through the book carefully, but there was nothing. Just pages of text. No hidden notes, no clues, nothing unusual.

*So it really was just a book,* you thought. *She really was just buying it. My suspicion was wrong.*

But that didn't mean Velma was innocent. It just meant the book wasn't the key to the mystery.

*I need to focus on the murder,* you thought. *The book is a red herring. The real evidence points to Marcus.*

You needed to focus on Marcus, and gather more evidence against him.

What do you do?
