# Sharing Evidence with Officer Martinez

You laid out everything you'd found on the table in the café area. The torn note fragment. The letter opener. The silver button Yuzu had discovered. Eleanor's journal. Alistair Finch's business card. The letter from Alistair about Marcus stealing books.

Officer Martinez examined each piece carefully, taking notes. "This is very thorough," she said. "You've been very observant."

*I have,* you thought. *I've found all of this. I've put the pieces together.*

"You found the journal in the storage room?" Officer Martinez asked.

"Yes," you said. "Yuzu led me there. He found it."

Officer Martinez looked at Yuzu, who was sitting at your feet, watching the proceedings with those bright, intelligent eyes. "He's a good dog," she said.

*The best,* you thought.

"You've done excellent work," Officer Martinez said. "But I need to ask you to step back now. Let the police handle the investigation from here. We'll process all this evidence properly, verify everything, and follow up on the leads you've found."

*But I want to keep going,* you thought. *I want to see this through. I want to find the killer.*

"I understand," you said. "But I've come this far. I've found all this evidence. Can't I help? Can't I be part of the investigation?"

Officer Martinez's expression softened slightly. "I appreciate your help," she said. "But this is a murder investigation. We need to do it by the book. We need to follow procedure. And we need to make sure we have everything we need before we make any accusations."

*But I'm so close,* you thought. *I can feel it. I'm almost there.*

What do you do?
