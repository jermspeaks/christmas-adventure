# Helping the World Adjust

You focused on helping the world adjust to the changes, working to guide the magic, to show it where to go, to help it find balance. *The world needs help adjusting,* you thought. *I can help guide the magic, help it find balance, help the world adjust to the changes.*

You worked with the Keepsake Keeper, channeling its power, trying to guide the magic streams, to show them where to go, to help them find balance. You focused on the places that were struggling—the ones with too much magic, the ones with too little, the ones where the magic was confused.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as the magic began to respond, as it began to find balance, as the world began to adjust. *By helping guide the magic, I'm helping the world adjust to the changes.*

Cheshire trotted beside you, helping where they could, their presence supportive. "You're helping," they said. "You're guiding the magic, helping it find balance, helping the world adjust. That's what the world needs—guidance, not control. Help, not force."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Helping the world adjust is important," it said. "When you guide the magic, help it find balance, show it where to go, you help the whole world adjust to the changes. That's what you're doing now."

You looked out at the world, at the way the magic was beginning to find balance, at the way the world was beginning to adjust. *This is working,* you thought. *By helping guide the magic, I'm helping the world adjust to the changes, find balance, create connection.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some places were easy to help, but others were more complex. Some magic streams were simple to guide, but others needed more time, more understanding, more work.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some places need more help, more guidance, more time. How do we address all of them?*

What do you do?
