# Letting Kvothe Lead

You stepped back, letting Kvothe take the lead completely. *They understand the magic better than I do,* you thought. *They were the guardian. They know how it works. They can guide it better than I can.*

You watched as Kvothe worked, channeling the Keepsake Keeper's power, guiding the magic, showing it where to go, helping it find balance. And as you did, you saw the magic responding, finding balance, flowing more smoothly.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as Kvothe guided the magic, as it responded, as balance was found. *By letting them lead, by trusting their understanding, I'm helping the magic find balance.*

Cheshire trotted beside you, their eyes bright. "You're trusting Kvothe," they said. "You're letting them lead, trusting their understanding, their connection with the magic. That's what the magic needs—someone who understands it, who can guide it, who can help it find balance."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Trust creates connection," it said. "When you trust Kvothe, when you let them lead, when you support their guidance, the magic responds, finds balance, creates connection. That's what you're doing now."

You looked at Kvothe, at the way they were guiding the magic, at the way it was responding, at the way balance was being found. *This is working,* you thought. *By letting them lead, by trusting their understanding, I'm helping the magic find balance.*

But as you watched, you began to notice something. Some magic streams were easy for Kvothe to guide, but others were more complex. Some places were simple to help, but others needed more time, more understanding, more work.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some magic streams need more help, more guidance, more time. How do we address all of them?*

What do you do?
