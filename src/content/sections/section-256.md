# Finding the Real Solution

You investigated further, and you discovered the truth. The magic wasn't balanced—it was suppressed. It wasn't flowing freely—it was being held back. You realized you needed to find the real solution, not accept a false one.

*I need to truly balance it,* you thought. *Not suppress it, but balance it. Help it flow freely, help it find its way.*

You began working on the real solution, helping the magic truly balance, truly flow, truly find its way. It was harder, took longer, but it was real. It was a true solution, not a false one.

*This is the right way,* you thought. *This is how it should be done.*

What do you do?
