# Partial Restoration

You convinced the guardian to help, but you rushed the magic restoration. You didn't take time to do it properly, to ensure it was complete, to make sure everything was right. You opened the vault, and the magic began to flow, but it wasn't complete.

*It's working,* you thought, relief flooding through you. *The magic is being restored.*

But as the magic flowed, you realized something was wrong. It wasn't flowing completely. Some of it remained locked away. The restoration was partial, incomplete, not fully successful.

*It's only partially restored,* you realized. *Some of the magic is still locked away.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light flickered, and you heard its voice, concerned. "The restoration is partial," it said. "You rushed it, and some of the magic remains locked away. The world will have magic again, but not all of it. Not completely."

*I should have taken my time,* you thought. *I should have done it properly.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—partially restored, incomplete, a reminder that rushing leads to incomplete results, that taking time is important, that doing things properly matters.
