# Ignored System

You decided to ignore the new system, to just hope it worked, to not try to learn it. You thought it would work on its own, that you didn't need to understand it. You ignored it completely.

*It will work on its own,* you thought. *I don't need to learn it.*

But ignoring the system only made the magic unstable, unpredictable, dangerous. It didn't work properly, couldn't be controlled, became a danger to everyone.

*It's not working,* you thought. *The magic is dangerous.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You ignored the new system," it said, its voice sad. "But the magic requires understanding, learning, connection. Without it, the magic becomes unstable, unpredictable, dangerous. You ignored it, and the magic became dangerous."

*I ignored it,* you realized. *I made the magic dangerous.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains dangerous—unstable, unpredictable, a reminder that understanding is essential, that learning is more important than hoping.
