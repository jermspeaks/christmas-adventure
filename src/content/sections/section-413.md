# Refused Cooperation

You refused to work with Kvothe, thinking you could do it alone, that you didn't need their help, that cooperation wasn't necessary. You pushed them away, tried to do everything yourself.

*I don't need their help,* you thought. *I can do this alone.*

But the Memory Vault required cooperation. It needed both you and Kvothe working together, combining your strengths, sharing your purpose. Without that cooperation, you couldn't open the vault. Your attempts failed, and the magic remained locked.

*This isn't working,* you realized, but it was too late.

Kvothe became more resistant, more determined to keep the magic locked away. You couldn't convince them, couldn't work with them, couldn't help. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever.

*I should have worked with them,* you thought. *I should have cooperated, not tried to do it alone.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that cooperation is essential, that we cannot do everything alone, that working together is more important than working alone.
