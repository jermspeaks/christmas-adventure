# Watching and Waiting

You stayed back, watching, waiting, seeing if more problems would arise. *Maybe I should wait,* you thought. *Maybe I should see what else happens before I intervene.*

But as you watched, the problems you'd noticed began to grow. The group trying to use the magic the old way became more frustrated, their attempts more desperate. The place where the magic was unbalanced became more unstable, flickering more wildly. The fragile connection became weaker, more tenuous.

*The problems are getting worse,* you realized, watching as small issues became bigger ones. *I should have addressed them when I first noticed them. Now they're harder to fix.*

You saw Elara trying to help the frustrated group, but they weren't listening. They were too frustrated, too desperate, too lost in their attempts to make the old magic work. The unbalanced magic was affecting more of the celebration, spreading its instability. The fragile connection was beginning to break.

*I waited too long,* you thought, a cold feeling settling in your stomach. *I should have addressed these problems when they were small. Now they're bigger, harder to fix, affecting more of the celebration.*

Cheshire trotted over to you, their eyes concerned. "The problems are growing," they said. "The ones you noticed are getting worse, and they're affecting more of the celebration. You should have addressed them when they were small, when they were easier to fix."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed urgently. "Problems grow when they're not addressed," it said. "When you notice a problem early, you can fix it easily. But when you wait, it grows, it spreads, it becomes harder to fix. The problems you noticed are now bigger, affecting more of the celebration."

*I made a mistake,* you realized. *I should have addressed the problems when I first noticed them. Now they're harder to fix, but maybe I can still help. Maybe it's not too late.*

You looked at the growing problems, at the way they were affecting the celebration, at the way they were spreading. *I need to address them now,* you thought. *Even if it's harder, I have to try. I have to help fix what I can.*

What do you do?
