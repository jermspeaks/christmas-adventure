# Questioning Marcus About the Rare Books

You asked Marcus about the rare book collection, and his expression became guarded. *He's hiding something,* you thought.

"The rare book collection is valuable," Marcus said. "Very valuable. Eleanor was very protective of it. She didn't like to sell things from it. She said it was her legacy."

*But what if someone was selling things from it anyway?* you thought. *What if Marcus was stealing books and selling them?*

You thought about the letter from Alistair: *I know what Marcus has been doing. I can prove he's been stealing from your collection.*

*Alistair knew,* you thought. *He had proof. And he was going to give it to Eleanor.*

"Marcus," you said, "have you ever sold any books from the collection? Without Eleanor's knowledge?"

Marcus's face went white. "What? No. Of course not. I would never—"

*But his reaction says otherwise,* you thought. *He's lying. I can see it in his face.*

"You're sure?" you asked. "Because I found a letter. From Alistair Finch. He says he can prove you've been stealing books. He was going to give Eleanor the evidence."

Marcus was silent for a long moment. Then he said, "I... I made a mistake. I was in debt. I needed money. I thought I could sell a few books, replace them later, and no one would notice. But Eleanor found out. She was going to fire me. She was going to change her will."

*So he had a motive,* you thought. *He was stealing, Eleanor found out, and he killed her to keep her from exposing him.*

But was that enough? Did you have proof?

What do you do?
