# Forced Open

You tried to force the vault open without understanding, without working with the guardian, without truly knowing what you were doing. You thought force was enough, that understanding wasn't necessary.

*I just need to open it,* you thought. *Force should work.*

But the Memory Vault couldn't be forced. It required understanding, cooperation, genuine Christmas spirit. Without that, your attempts to force it open only made things worse. The vault became more resistant, the magic more unstable.

*This isn't working,* you realized, but it was too late.

The vault reacted to your force, and something went wrong. The magic became unstable, dangerous. You couldn't control it, couldn't help. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever.

*I should have understood first,* you thought. *I should have worked with the guardian, not against them.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that force is not the answer, that understanding is essential, that cooperation is more important than control.
