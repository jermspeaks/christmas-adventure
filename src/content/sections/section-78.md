# Researching Alistair's Business and Alibi

You decided to research Alistair's business and verify his alibi, thinking that would help you determine if he was involved in the murder.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez about Alistair's alibi, and she confirmed it. "We've verified it," she said. "Alistair was at an auction in the city from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Dozens of witnesses saw him there. He couldn't have been at the bookshop when Eleanor was killed."

*So he has a solid alibi,* you thought. *He couldn't have done it.*

You also asked about his business, and Officer Martinez told you what she knew. "Alistair is a legitimate rare book dealer," she said. "He's been in business for years. He's been trying to buy Eleanor's collection, but she refused to sell. When she refused, he started sending letters, but they weren't threats—they were offers. He was trying to help her, not hurt her."

*So he wasn't threatening her,* you thought. *He was trying to help. And he has an alibi. So he probably didn't do it.*

But you also learned something else. "We found records of sales between Alistair and Marcus," Officer Martinez said. "Marcus was selling books from Eleanor's collection to Alistair, and Alistair was buying them, knowing they were stolen."

*So they were working together,* you thought. *But if Alistair has an alibi, and he was trying to help Eleanor, then maybe he wasn't involved in the murder. Maybe it was just Marcus.*

You needed to investigate their relationship more carefully, to see if they were really working together, or if something else was going on.

What do you do?
