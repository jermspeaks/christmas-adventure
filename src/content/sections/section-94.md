# Rushing to Judgment

You stuck to your theory, even though you knew you didn't have enough evidence. You were so eager to solve the case, so desperate to find the killer, that you convinced yourself you had enough.

But you didn't. Your evidence was weak. Your theory was flawed. And when the police investigated, they found nothing. Your leads went nowhere. Your suspicions were unfounded.

The real killer was never found. The case went cold. Eleanor's murder remained unsolved.

You visited Tombs and Trinkets sometimes, and you'd think about what had happened. You'd rushed to judgment. You'd been so eager to solve the case that you'd stopped being careful. You'd stopped gathering evidence. You'd stopped being thorough.

*I was wrong,* you thought. *I let my desire to solve the case cloud my judgment. I rushed, and I made mistakes.*

Yuzu was still there, still greeting customers with his usual enthusiasm. But when he saw you, he'd look at you with those bright, intelligent eyes, and you'd feel a pang of guilt. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows I didn't do it right.*

The truth was never found. Justice was never served. And it was your fault, because you'd been so eager to solve the case that you'd stopped being careful. You'd stopped being thorough. You'd stopped doing the work.

*I should have been more patient,* you thought. *I should have gathered all the evidence. I should have verified everything. I should have been certain before I tried to solve the case.*

But it was too late now. The damage was done. The case was cold. And Eleanor's killer was still out there, free.

The story ends here, but the mystery remains unsolved.
