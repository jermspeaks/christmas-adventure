# Looking for Evidence of Tension Between Marcus and Eleanor

You decided to look for evidence of tension between Marcus and Eleanor, thinking that would help you understand their relationship better.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You went through Eleanor's journal more carefully, looking for entries about Marcus. You found several:

*December 15th: Marcus is acting strange. I should talk to him.*
*December 18th: Another book missing. I need to check the inventory.*
*December 20th: The rare book collection. Someone knows. Someone's been asking questions.*
*December 22nd: Tonight. I'll confront them tonight. It has to end.*

*So she was definitely worried about him,* you thought. *She noticed something was wrong. She noticed books were missing. And she was planning to confront him.*

You also found a draft of a termination letter in Eleanor's files, dated yesterday. She was going to fire Marcus for stealing books.

*So there was definitely tension,* you thought. *Eleanor had discovered Marcus was stealing, and she was going to fire him. And he knew it.*

*That's a strong motive,* you thought. *If Marcus found out Eleanor was going to fire him, and he would lose everything, then he might have killed her to keep her from doing it.*

You needed to confront Marcus with all this evidence, and get him to tell the truth.

What do you do?
