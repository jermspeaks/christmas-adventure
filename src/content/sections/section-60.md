# Learning About the Police Investigation

You asked Officer Martinez about the police investigation, and she was surprisingly open with you. "We've been looking into several leads," she said. "Alistair Finch has been harassing Eleanor for weeks, sending threatening letters. We found more of them in her office."

*So they know about Alistair,* you thought.

"We've also been looking into Marcus Chen," Officer Martinez continued. "Eleanor's assistant. He's been having financial troubles, and we found evidence that he's been selling rare books from the collection without Eleanor's knowledge."

*They know about Marcus too,* you thought. *So I'm on the right track.*

"What about Velma Ousley?" you asked.

Officer Martinez shook her head. "We've looked into her. She has an alibi—she was in the mystery section the whole time, and other customers saw her there. She found Eleanor's body, but there's no evidence connecting her to the murder."

*So Velma is probably innocent,* you thought. *Which means it's either Marcus or Alistair.*

"But Alistair has an alibi too," Officer Martinez said, as if reading your thoughts. "He was at an auction in the city, with dozens of witnesses. He couldn't have been here when Eleanor was killed."

*So if Alistair has an alibi, and Velma has an alibi, then it has to be Marcus,* you thought.

"But we need proof," Officer Martinez said. "We can't just arrest someone based on suspicion. We need evidence. Physical evidence. Something that definitively connects someone to the crime."

*I have evidence,* you thought. *The silver button. The inconsistencies in Marcus's alibi. The letter from Alistair. Eleanor's journal.*

"What about the evidence I found?" you asked.

Officer Martinez nodded. "We'll process it all. But it takes time. We need to verify everything, check the handwriting, analyze the button, verify the timeline. These things can't be rushed."

*But I want to solve it now,* you thought. *I want to find the killer.*

What do you do?
