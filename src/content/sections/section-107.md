# Verifying That Velma Actually Paid for the Book

You decided to verify that Velma actually paid for the book, thinking that would help you determine if she was telling the truth.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You checked the receipt Velma had shown you, and it looked legitimate. It was dated that morning, for a first edition of *Murder on the Orient Express*. The receipt matched the book she was holding.

You also checked Eleanor's records, and you found a record of the sale. Velma had indeed paid for the book that morning.

*So she did pay for it,* you thought. *She wasn't stealing it. My suspicion was wrong.*

But that didn't mean Velma was innocent. It just meant the book wasn't the key to the mystery.

*I need to focus on the murder,* you thought. *The book is a red herring. The real evidence points to Marcus.*

You needed to focus on Marcus, and gather more evidence against him.

What do you do?
