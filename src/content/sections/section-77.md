# Calling Alistair Finch

You decided to call Alistair Finch directly, thinking he might have information that could help solve the case.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You found his phone number on the business card you'd discovered, and you called him. He answered on the second ring, his voice sharp and businesslike.

"Alistair Finch," he said.

"This is about Eleanor Shellstrop," you said. "I need to ask you some questions."

There was a long pause. Then Alistair said, "Eleanor? What about her? Is she all right?"

*He doesn't know,* you thought. *Or he's pretending not to know.*

"Eleanor is dead," you said. "She was murdered this afternoon."

Another long pause. Then Alistair said, "What? That's... that's terrible. I can't believe it."

*Is he telling the truth?* you wondered. *Or is he acting?*

"You've been sending her threatening letters," you said. "Why?"

"I wasn't threatening her," Alistair said, his voice defensive. "I was trying to help her. I found out that Marcus was stealing books from her collection, and I was going to give her the evidence. I wrote her a letter, telling her I could prove it."

*So the letter was real,* you thought. *He was trying to help, not threaten.*

"But what about the torn note?" you asked. "The one that said 'before Christmas Eve or else'?"

"I don't know anything about that," Alistair said. "I didn't write that. That wasn't from me."

*So someone else wrote it,* you thought. *Maybe Marcus, to make it look like Alistair was the bad guy.*

You needed to investigate more carefully. You needed to verify Alistair's alibi, and check if he really was at that auction.

What do you do?
