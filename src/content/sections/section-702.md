# Genuine Spirit Alone

You realized your mistake and let go of the power entirely. *Power alone isn't enough,* you thought. *I need to show them the genuine spirit, the real connection, the true feeling. Not the power, but what the power represents.*

You put the Keepsake Keeper down and closed your eyes, thinking about what Christmas really meant to you—not the magic, not the power, but the feeling. The connection, the joy, the hope, the genuine spirit. You let yourself feel it, really feel it, and you let that feeling flow through you, into the clearing, into the guardian.

*This is different,* you realized, opening your eyes and seeing the guardian's expression change. *I'm not showing power—I'm just feeling, just being, just showing what Christmas really means. The genuine spirit, the real connection, the true feeling.*

The guardian's eyes widened, and you saw something in them—recognition, memory, feeling. "You're... feeling it," they said, their voice soft, almost wondering. "You're not showing power—you're just feeling. Remembering. Connecting. Showing what Christmas really means."

*They're feeling it too,* you thought, hope growing. *They're remembering, connecting, feeling what Christmas really means. Not the power, but the spirit behind it.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes bright with joy. "You're showing it," they said. "You're showing what Christmas really means—not with power, but with genuine spirit, with real connection, with true feeling. That's what the guardian needs to see, to feel, to remember."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly, its light steady and strong. "Genuine spirit is what Christmas is about," it said. "Not power, not magic, but feeling, connection, joy, hope. When you show that genuine spirit, you show what Christmas really means. That's what the guardian needs to experience."

You looked at the guardian, at the way their expression had changed, at the recognition in their eyes. *This is working,* you thought. *By showing genuine spirit, by feeling and connecting, I'm helping them remember what Christmas really means. I'm helping them feel it, remember it, connect with it.*

But the guardian's expression was still uncertain, still guarded. *They're feeling it, but they're not fully convinced yet. I need to help them remember more, feel more, connect more.*

What do you do?
