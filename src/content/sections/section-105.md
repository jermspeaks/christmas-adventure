# Investigating Why Velma Didn't Call for Help

You decided to investigate why Velma didn't call for help immediately, thinking that was suspicious behavior.

Yuzu stayed close, watching Velma carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Velma why she didn't call for help immediately, and she said, "I was in shock. I didn't know what to do. I panicked. I went back to browsing, trying to process what I'd seen."

*But that doesn't make sense,* you thought. *Most people would call for help immediately, even if they were in shock. Going back to browsing seems like a strange reaction.*

"Most people would call for help," you said. "Even if they were in shock. Why didn't you?"

Velma's face tightened. "I don't know. I just... I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I thought maybe... maybe I was wrong. Maybe she was just... I don't know. I was confused."

*That still doesn't make sense,* you thought. *If you found someone on the floor, covered in blood, you'd know something was wrong. You wouldn't just go back to browsing.*

*Unless you're hiding something,* you thought. *Unless you're the killer, and you're trying to cover it up.*

You needed to investigate more carefully. You needed to check if Velma was telling the truth, or if she was hiding something.

What do you do?
