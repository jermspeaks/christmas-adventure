# Practicing the New Way

You closed your eyes and thought about a favorite Christmas memory—a moment when you'd felt truly connected, truly joyful, truly warm. You didn't try to control the magic. You just remembered. You felt the emotion, the connection, the warmth of that moment.

And immediately, you felt the magic respond. It flowed around you, warm and steady, carrying that memory, sharing it, making it real. The magic wasn't following your commands—it was responding to your feeling, to your memory, to your connection.

*This is how it works,* you thought, opening your eyes and watching as the magic flowed, as it responded to what you were feeling. *I just need to remember, to feel, to connect. The magic does the rest.*

You tried again, thinking about another memory, feeling the emotion, the connection. And again, the magic responded, flowing smoothly, naturally, like it was a part of you.

*I'm getting better at this,* you realized, a smile forming on your face. *I'm learning how to work with the magic, how to connect with it, how to let it respond to what I'm feeling.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "You're learning," it said, its voice pleased. "You're practicing, and you're getting better. The magic responds to connection, to memory, to emotion. And you're learning to connect, to remember, to feel."

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes bright. "You're building confidence," they said. "You're learning that the new way works, that it's natural, that it feels right. That's what practice does—it helps you understand, helps you trust, helps you grow."

You looked at the magic, at the way it was flowing, at the way it was responding to your memories, your emotions, your connections. *This feels right,* you thought. *This feels natural. This feels like how magic should be—not controlled, but connected. Not forced, but felt.*

*I'm learning. And I'm getting better.*
