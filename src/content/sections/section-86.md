# Sharing Everything Too Quickly

"I have everything," you said, spreading your evidence out on Officer Martinez's desk. "The button, the note, the letter, Eleanor's journal. It all points to Marcus Chen. He killed her. He was stealing rare books, Eleanor found out, and he killed her to keep her from exposing him."

Officer Martinez looked at the evidence, her expression thoughtful. "This is interesting," she said. "But we'll need to verify everything. The handwriting analysis, the button, the financial records. We can't just arrest someone based on what you've found."

"But I'm certain," you said. "I've put it all together. Marcus is the killer."

Officer Martinez nodded. "We'll investigate. But I need you to understand—we can't rush this. We need to do it properly. And I need you to let us handle it from here."

But you were so certain, so confident, that you couldn't help yourself. You went back to the shop and started talking to people. You told Velma your theory. You mentioned your suspicions about Marcus. You shared details of the investigation that you probably shouldn't have shared.

*I'm helping,* you thought. *I'm making sure everyone knows the truth.*

But you weren't helping. You were creating problems. Velma was upset that you'd suspected her earlier. Other people in the shop were talking, spreading rumors. The investigation was becoming a spectacle, and you were at the center of it.

When Officer Martinez found out what you'd been doing, she was not happy. "I told you to let us handle this," she said. "You've compromised the investigation. You've created problems that we now have to deal with."

*But I was just trying to help,* you thought. *I was just trying to find the truth.*

And you had found the truth. When the police finished their investigation, Marcus was arrested and charged. You'd been right about him, in the end.

But you'd also been wrong about how you'd handled it. You'd rushed. You'd shared information you shouldn't have shared. You'd created suspicion and problems that wouldn't have existed if you'd been more careful, if you'd let the police do their job properly.

The truth had been found, but not without complications.
