# Gathering Clues

The storage room behind the bookshop was exactly what you'd expect from a place called Tombs and Trinkets—cramped, dusty, and filled with boxes of books, old furniture, and what looked like decades of accumulated treasures. Yuzu trotted ahead of you, his nose to the ground, sniffing with the intensity of a dog who knew he was on a mission.

*If dogs could be detectives,* you thought, *Yuzu would be the best one.*

You found several interesting things. A box of old letters, tied with a faded ribbon, sitting on a shelf that looked like it hadn't been touched in years. A stack of invoices, some marked "PAST DUE" in red ink. And tucked behind a stack of boxes, a small notebook with Eleanor's elegant handwriting.

You flipped through it, your heart sinking as you read. The entries were recent, dated over the past few weeks, and they told a story you hadn't expected.

*December 15th: Another threat. This has to stop.*
*December 18th: Marcus is acting strange. I should talk to him.*
*December 20th: The rare book collection. Someone knows. Someone's been asking questions.*
*December 22nd: Tonight. I'll confront them tonight. It has to end.*

*Tonight,* you thought. *She was going to confront someone tonight. And now she's dead.*

Yuzu pawed at something under one of the boxes—a business card. You picked it up. It was for a rare book dealer, someone named "Alistair Finch," with an address in the city. The card was creased, as if it had been handled many times, and someone had written a phone number on the back in handwriting that wasn't Eleanor's.

When you returned to the main shop, you overheard Marcus talking to Officer Martinez. His voice was strained, defensive.

"I told you, I was in the rare books section the whole time," he said. "I have the catalog to prove it. I was working on the new acquisition—a first edition of *The Maltese Falcon*. Eleanor was excited about it. She'd been trying to get it for years."

*The rare book collection,* you thought, remembering Eleanor's journal entry. *Someone knows. Someone's been asking questions.*

You also noticed something else. Velma Ousley was still there, still browsing, as if nothing had happened. But when she thought no one was looking, you saw her slip something into her purse—something small and rectangular that might have been a book, or might have been something else entirely.

*Everyone has secrets,* you realized. *The question is, which secrets are about murder?*

What do you do?
