# Researching Marcus's Financial Situation

You decided to investigate Marcus's financial situation, thinking it might reveal a motive. *If he was in debt,* you thought, *and he was stealing rare books to pay it off, then he had a strong motive to kill Eleanor when she found out.*

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood the importance of what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez about Marcus's financial records, and she was surprisingly helpful. "We've been looking into that," she said. "Marcus has been having financial troubles. Credit card debt, student loans, medical bills. He's been struggling for months."

*So he needed money,* you thought. *And rare books are valuable. If he was stealing them and selling them, he could have made a lot of money.*

"You found evidence that he's been selling rare books?" you asked.

Officer Martinez nodded. "We found records of several sales over the past few months. Books that should have been in Eleanor's collection, but were sold to dealers. The money went into Marcus's account."

*So he was definitely stealing,* you thought. *And if Eleanor found out, she would have fired him. She would have changed her will. He would have lost everything.*

*That's a strong motive,* you thought. *If Eleanor was about to expose him, and he would lose his job, his inheritance, his reputation, then he might have killed her to keep her quiet.*

But you needed more. You needed to know if Eleanor had actually found out. You needed to know if she'd confronted him. You needed to know if that was what had led to her death.

What do you do?
