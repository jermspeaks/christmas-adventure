# Controlled Community

You decided to try to control the community's understanding, to make them think what you wanted, to be in charge. You thought you knew what was best, that you should control them. You tried to control them.

*I know what's best,* you thought. *I should control them.*

But trying to control the community only made them resist, rebel, reject you. The magic lost its connection power, and everything fell apart.

*They're resisting,* you thought. *The magic is losing power.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You tried to control the community," it said, its voice sad. "But understanding requires freedom, connection, trust. You tried to control them, and they resisted, the magic lost its connection power. Everything fell apart."

*I tried to control them,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the community remains broken—resisting, magic weakened, a reminder that control is not the answer, that freedom is more important than control.
