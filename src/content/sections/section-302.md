# Stable Flow

You worked to truly balance the magic flow, and it stabilized. It wasn't perfect—some areas were still slightly different, some places had changed permanently—but it was stable. The magic was flowing, sharing, balancing. Everything was... better. Not perfect, but better.

*It's working,* you thought, relief mixed with acceptance. *The magic flow is stable. Not perfectly balanced, but stable. Some areas have changed, but that's okay. Change isn't bad—it's just different.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "The magic flow is stable," it said, its voice thoughtful. "Not perfectly balanced, but stable. Some areas have changed permanently, but that's okay. Change isn't bad—it's just different. The magic is flowing, and that's what matters."

*The magic is flowing,* you realized. *Not perfectly, but stably. And that's what matters.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—flowing, stable, a reminder that perfection isn't necessary, that stability is enough, that change isn't bad, just different.
