# Investigating Alistair Finch's Business Dealings

You decided to investigate Alistair Finch's business dealings, thinking they might reveal something important about the case.

Yuzu stayed close, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

You asked Officer Martinez about Alistair, and she told you what she knew. "Alistair Finch is a rare book dealer," she said. "He's been trying to buy Eleanor's rare book collection for months. When she refused, he started sending threatening letters."

*So he wanted the collection,* you thought. *And when Eleanor refused to sell, he threatened her.*

"But he has an alibi," Officer Martinez continued. "He was at an auction in the city when Eleanor was killed. Dozens of witnesses saw him there. He couldn't have been here."

*But what if he hired someone?* you wondered. *What if he was working with someone? What if he was working with Marcus?*

You thought about the letter you'd found from Alistair. It said he knew Marcus was stealing books, and he was going to give Eleanor the evidence. *So Alistair wasn't threatening Eleanor,* you thought. *He was trying to help her. He was going to expose Marcus.*

*But then why the torn note?* you wondered. *The one that said "before Christmas Eve or else..." That sounded like a threat. But if Alistair was trying to help, why would he threaten her?*

*Unless someone else wrote it,* you thought. *Unless Marcus wrote it to make it look like Alistair was the bad guy. Unless Marcus was trying to frame Alistair.*

You needed to investigate Alistair's business dealings more carefully. You needed to check his alibi, verify his relationship with Eleanor, and see if he had any connection to Marcus.

What do you do?
