# Helping Kvothe Truly Transform

You noticed that something seemed off, and you investigated. You discovered the truth. Kvothe wasn't truly adjusting—they were suppressing. They weren't transforming—they were hiding. You realized you needed to help them truly transform, not accept a false solution.

*I need to help them truly transform,* you thought. *Not suppress, but transform. Help them face their true self, help them become who they're meant to be.*

You began helping Kvothe truly transform, facing their true self, becoming who they were meant to be. It was harder, took longer, but it was real. It was a true transformation, not a false one.

*This is the right way,* you thought. *This is how it should be done.*

What do you do?
