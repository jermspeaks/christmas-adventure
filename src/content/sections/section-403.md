# Ignored Warnings

You ignored Cheshire's warnings and rushed ahead alone, thinking you knew better, that you didn't need to be careful. You charged forward, ignoring their advice, their guidance, their concern.

*I don't need to be careful,* you thought. *I can handle this.*

But Cheshire's warnings were there for a reason. The magical world was dangerous, especially now that the magic was fading. Without their guidance, you quickly found yourself in trouble. You got lost, you made mistakes, you put yourself in danger.

*This is worse than I thought,* you realized, but it was too late.

The magic continued to fade, and you remained lost, unable to find your way, unable to help. Christmas Eve arrived, and the magic disappeared completely. Christmas faded forever, and you were left lost, alone, unable to make a difference.

*I should have listened,* you thought. *I should have heeded the warnings.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that warnings exist for a reason, that caution is not cowardice, that listening is essential.
