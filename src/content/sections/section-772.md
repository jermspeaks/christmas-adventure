# Understanding Why Magic Avoids

You focused on understanding why the magic was avoiding these places, trying to see the pattern, to understand the reason, to figure out what was different.

You studied the empty places, comparing them to places where magic flowed freely. You looked at the memories, the connections, the traditions. And as you did, you began to see the pattern—places with Christmas memories had magic, places without didn't.

*That's it,* you realized. *The magic recognizes places with Christmas memories, but it doesn't recognize places without. It's not that the magic doesn't want to go there—it's that it doesn't know how. It doesn't have memories to connect to.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes thoughtful. "You're understanding it," they said. "The magic recognizes places with Christmas memories, but it doesn't recognize places without. It's not that the magic doesn't want to go there—it's that it doesn't know how. It needs memories to connect to."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Understanding creates solutions," it said. "When you understand why the magic avoids these places, when you see the pattern, when you recognize what's missing, you can help the magic understand, help it recognize, help it connect. That's what you're doing now."

You looked at the empty places, at the way they lacked memories, at the way the magic didn't recognize them. *This is the problem,* you thought. *These places don't have Christmas memories, so the magic doesn't know how to reach them. But they deserve magic too. They just need help creating memories, building connections.*

*Now that I understand,* you thought, *I can help. I can help create memories, build connections, show the magic that these places deserve magic too.*
