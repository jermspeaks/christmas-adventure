# Asking Marcus About Conflicts with Eleanor

You asked Marcus about any recent conflicts with Eleanor, thinking that might reveal more about his motive.

Yuzu stayed close, watching Marcus carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

Marcus hesitated, then said, "We... we had some disagreements. About the collection. About how to run things. But nothing serious. Nothing that would..."

*Nothing that would lead to murder?* you thought. *But what if it was more serious than he's letting on?*

"What kind of disagreements?" you asked.

Marcus's face tightened. "Just... business stuff. How to catalog things. How to price things. Nothing important."

*But it was important enough for Eleanor to write about it in her journal,* you thought. *It was important enough for her to be worried.*

You thought about Eleanor's journal entry: *Marcus is acting strange. I should talk to him.*

*She was worried about him,* you thought. *She noticed something was wrong. And she was planning to confront him.*

"Eleanor was planning to confront you," you said. "She wrote about it in her journal. She was going to talk to you tonight."

Marcus's face went pale. "What? No. She didn't... I didn't know that."

*But you did know,* you thought. *You knew she'd found out about the stolen books. You knew she was going to confront you. And you killed her before she could.*

You needed to press him harder, or look for more evidence of the conflicts.

What do you do?
