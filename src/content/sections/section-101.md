# Asking Marcus Directly About Stealing Books

You decided to ask Marcus directly if he'd been stealing books, thinking that would be the most direct way to get to the truth.

Yuzu stayed close, watching Marcus carefully, as if he understood what you were doing.

"Marcus," you said, "have you been stealing books from Eleanor's collection?"

Marcus's face went white. "What? No. Of course not. I would never—"

*But his reaction says otherwise,* you thought. *He's lying. I can see it in his face.*

"I found a letter from Alistair Finch," you said. "He says he can prove you've been stealing books. He was going to give Eleanor the evidence."

Marcus was silent for a long moment. Then he said, "I... I made a mistake. I was in debt. I needed money. I thought I could sell a few books, replace them later, and no one would notice. But Eleanor found out. She was going to fire me. She was going to change her will."

*So he was definitely stealing,* you thought. *And Eleanor found out. And she was going to fire him. And he killed her to keep her from doing it.*

"You killed her," you said. "You killed her because she found out you were stealing, and you didn't want to lose everything."

Marcus's face tightened. "I didn't mean to," he said. "We argued, and I panicked, and I grabbed the letter opener, and... I didn't mean to kill her. It just happened."

*So he's confessing,* you thought. *Finally.*

You needed to get him to confess properly to the police, or present all your evidence to Officer Martinez.

What do you do?
