# Working Together with Kvothe

You and Kvothe worked together, channeling the Keepsake Keeper's power, trying to guide the magic, to show it where to go, to help it find balance. *Together, we can do this,* you thought. *We can show the magic that we're all connected, that we all care, that we all want to help.*

You worked side by side, your connection with Kvothe strengthening, your shared purpose clear. And as you did, you saw the magic respond better than when you'd tried alone. The magic was moving, finding some balance, responding to your connection, your shared purpose, your working together.

*This is working,* you thought, watching as the magic began to find balance, as it responded to your connection, your shared purpose. *By working together, by showing the magic that we're connected, that we care, that we want to help, I'm helping it find balance.*

Cheshire trotted beside you, their eyes bright. "You're working together," they said. "You're showing the magic connection, care, help. That's what the magic needs—not just one person, but connection, shared purpose, working together."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "Working together creates connection," it said. "When you work with Kvothe, when you show the magic that you're connected, that you care, that you want to help, the magic responds, finds balance, creates connection. That's what you're doing now."

You looked at Kvothe, at the way you were working together, at the way the magic was responding, at the way balance was being found. *This is working,* you thought. *By working together, by showing the magic connection, care, help, I'm helping it find balance.*

But as you worked, you began to notice something. Some magic streams were easy to guide together, but others were more complex. Some places were simple to help, but others needed more time, more understanding, more work.

*We're making progress,* you thought. *But there are still challenges. Some magic streams need more help, more guidance, more time. How do we address all of them?*

What do you do?
