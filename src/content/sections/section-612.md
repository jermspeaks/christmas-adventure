# Holding Onto the Old Way

You tried again. *It has to work,* you thought, frustration building. *The old way has to work. I know how to do this.*

You reached out, trying to control the magic, to direct it, to make it do what you wanted. You pushed harder, tried different techniques, different approaches. But nothing worked. The magic just sat there, unresponsive, like it was waiting for something you weren't giving it.

*Why isn't it working?* you thought, your frustration turning to something else—anger, maybe, or desperation. *I know how to do this. I've done it before. Why isn't it working now?*

You tried again, and again, and again, but the magic didn't respond. It didn't follow your commands. It didn't do what you wanted. It just... waited.

*This doesn't make sense,* you realized, finally stopping, your hands shaking with frustration. *The magic should work. I know how to use it. Why isn't it working?*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes gentle but firm. "The old way doesn't work anymore," they said. "The magic has changed. It's not about control or power now—it's about connection, about memory, about emotion. You can't force it to work the old way because the old way doesn't exist anymore."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly. "Change is hard," it said. "It's natural to want to hold onto what you know, what you understand. But the magic has transformed, and it needs you to transform with it. You can't make the old way work because the old way is gone."

You looked at your hands, at the magic that wasn't responding, and you felt a pang of loss. *I don't know how to use this anymore,* you thought. *Everything I knew doesn't work.*

*But maybe that's okay,* you realized, slowly. *Maybe I need to learn something new. Maybe the old way wasn't the only way, or even the best way.*

*Maybe I need to let go and learn the new way.*
