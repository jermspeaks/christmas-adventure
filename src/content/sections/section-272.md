# True Balance

You investigated, and you discovered the truth. The magic wasn't truly balanced—it was draining. It wasn't flowing correctly—it was being pulled from other places. You realized you needed to find the real solution, not accept a false one.

*I need to truly balance it,* you thought. *Not drain from other places, but truly balance. Help it flow correctly, help it find true balance.*

You began working on the real solution, helping the magic truly balance, truly flow, truly find its way. It was harder, took longer, but it was real. It was a true solution, not a false one.

*This is the right way,* you thought. *This is how it should be done.*

What do you do?
