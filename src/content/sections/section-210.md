# Abandoned Kvothe

You decided to leave Kvothe to figure it out on their own, to stop helping, to just walk away. You thought they needed to do it themselves, that your help was holding them back. You left them alone, struggling, lost.

*They need to do it themselves,* you thought. *They don't need my help.*

But leaving Kvothe alone only made things worse. They became lost, overwhelmed, unable to find their way. They lost hope, lost the magic, lost everything.

*Maybe I should have stayed,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its sadness. "You abandoned Kvothe," it said, its voice sad. "You left them alone, thinking they needed to do it themselves. But transformation requires support, requires help, requires connection. You abandoned them, and they became lost, losing hope, losing the magic, losing everything."

*I abandoned them,* you realized. *I left them alone, and I lost them. I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but Kvothe remains lost—unable to transform, unable to find their way, a reminder that support is more important than independence, that help is more important than leaving someone alone, that connection is the only way to truly help someone transform.
