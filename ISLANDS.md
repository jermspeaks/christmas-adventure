# Islands Analysis

This file documents all sections that are "islands" - sections that exist but have no incoming links from other sections. These sections are unreachable through normal gameplay.

**What this means:**
- These sections cannot be reached by following choices from other sections
- They need to either be connected to the story (by adding a choice that points to them) or terminated
- Sections with choices need partial termination (remove or modify choices)
- Sections without choices are already terminated but may need story connection
