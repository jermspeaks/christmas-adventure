# Perfect Celebration

The celebration seemed perfect. Everyone was happy, joyful, celebrating. Everything seemed... perfect. Complete. Resolved.

*It's perfect,* you thought, joy flooding through you. *Everyone is happy. Everything is working.*

But as time passed, you began to notice something. The celebration wasn't really perfect—underlying issues were being ignored. Problems were being hidden, not addressed. The perfection was an illusion, a temporary fix that was hiding real problems.

*Something's not right,* you thought, but you weren't sure what. *There are problems being ignored. Issues being hidden.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly, and you could feel its concern. "Underlying issues are being ignored," it said, its voice worried. "Problems are being hidden, not addressed. This is not a solution. This is a delay. When the celebration ends, the problems will emerge, and they will be worse than before."

*Oh no,* you realized. *The celebration isn't perfect. Problems are being ignored. And when they emerge, they'll be worse.*

What do you do?
