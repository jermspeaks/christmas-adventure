# Marcus and Eleanor's Relationship

You asked Marcus about his relationship with Eleanor, and his expression changed. There was something there—sadness, yes, but also something else. Guilt? Fear?

"She was my boss," Marcus said. "But more than that. She was a mentor. She taught me everything I know about rare books. She was going to leave me the shop, you know. In her will. She told me that."

*So he had something to gain from her death,* you thought. *But only if certain conditions were met.*

"But recently?" you asked. "How was your relationship recently? Was everything okay between you?"

Marcus hesitated. "We... we had some disagreements. About the collection. About how to run things. But nothing serious. Nothing that would..."

*Nothing that would lead to murder?* you thought. *But what if it was more serious than he's letting on?*

You thought about Eleanor's journal entry: *Marcus is acting strange. I should talk to him.*

*She was worried about him,* you thought. *She noticed something was wrong. And she was planning to confront him.*

"What kind of disagreements?" you asked.

Marcus's face tightened. "Just... business stuff. How to catalog things. How to price things. Nothing important."

*But it was important enough for Eleanor to write about it in her journal,* you thought. *It was important enough for her to be worried.*

You needed to find out more. You needed to understand what had really been going on between them.

What do you do?
