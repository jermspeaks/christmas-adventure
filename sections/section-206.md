# Ignored Weakness

You decided to focus only on the places with too much magic, ignoring the weak ones. You thought that if you could just fix the overloaded areas, everything would work out. You didn't pay attention to the places that needed magic, didn't help them, didn't guide them.

*I'll fix the overloaded areas first,* you thought. *Then I'll deal with the weak ones.*

But ignoring the weak areas only made things worse. They became emptier, colder, more disconnected. The magic imbalance became permanent, with some areas having too much and others having nothing at all.

*Maybe I should have helped the weak areas too,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its disappointment. "You ignored the weak areas," it said, its voice sad. "You focused only on the overloaded places, but magic needs balance. It needs to flow to all places, not just some. You ignored the weak areas, and they became permanently empty, disconnected. The magic imbalance is now permanent, with no way to fix it."

*I ignored them,* you realized. *I focused only on the overloaded areas, and I lost the weak ones. I created permanent imbalance.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—imbalanced, with some areas overflowing and others empty, a reminder that balance requires attention to all areas, that ignoring problems doesn't make them go away, that help must be given to all who need it.
