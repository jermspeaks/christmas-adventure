# Kvothe's Guidance

You turned to Kvothe, asking them to help balance the magic flow. *They understand the magic,* you thought. *They were the guardian. They know how it works. They can help.*

Kvothe nodded, their expression thoughtful. "I can feel the imbalance," they said. "The magic is trying to restore itself, but it's remembering the old world, not understanding the new one. I can help guide it, but... I think we need to work together. The magic responds to connection, to shared purpose. If we work together, we can show it that we're all connected, that we all deserve Christmas magic."

*They're right,* you thought. *The magic needs to see connection, not just one person guiding it. Even if that person understands it well.*

You and Kvothe worked together, channeling the Keepsake Keeper's power, trying to guide the magic, to show it where to go, to help it find balance. The magic responded better than when you'd tried alone, but there was still something missing. The magic was moving, finding some balance, but it wasn't quite right. It was like it needed to see more connection, more people, more understanding.

*The magic needs to see that we're all in this together,* you realized. *Not just me and Kvothe, but everyone. It needs to see the whole community, the whole connection.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes bright. "You're making progress," they said. "But the magic needs to see more. It needs to see that we're all connected, that we all care, that we all want to help. Maybe you need to include others, to show the magic that it's not just about two people—it's about everyone."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "The magic responds to connection," it said. "It needs to see that we're all working together, that we all care, that we all want to help. When you work with just one other person, it's better than working alone, but it's still not enough. The magic needs to see the whole community."

*So we need to include others,* you thought. *We need to show the magic that we're all in this together, that we all deserve Christmas magic.*

What do you do?
