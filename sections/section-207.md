# Kael's Reversion

You decided to push Kael to remember everything at once, to process all their memories immediately. You didn't give them time, didn't let them go at their own pace. You pushed, trying to make them remember everything, trying to make them process it all at once.

*They need to remember everything,* you thought. *They need to process it all, right now.*

But pushing Kael too hard only made things worse. They became overwhelmed, drowning in memories, unable to process anything. The pressure was too much, and they began to revert, their transformation reversing, the shadows returning.

*No,* you thought. *This isn't what I wanted.*

But it was too late. Kael reverted completely, becoming the guardian of shadows again, locking the magic away once more. This time, they locked it away permanently, refusing to ever let it out again.

*I pushed too hard,* you realized. *I tried to make them remember everything at once, and I broke them. I lost them.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its sadness. "You pushed too hard," it said, its voice sad. "You tried to make Kael remember everything at once, but transformation takes time. It must be gentle, patient, understanding. You pushed too hard, and Kael reverted, becoming the guardian of shadows again, locking the magic away permanently."

*I pushed too hard,* you realized. *I lost Kael, and I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains locked away—permanently sealed, a reminder that transformation cannot be forced, that patience is more important than speed, that understanding is the only way to truly help someone change.
