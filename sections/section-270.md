# False Balance

The magic seemed to be flowing correctly. It was going to all the places it should, balancing itself, finding its way. Everything seemed... perfect. Balanced. Fixed.

*It's working,* you thought, relief flooding through you. *The magic is flowing correctly. Everything is balanced.*

But as time passed, you began to notice something. The magic wasn't really balanced—it was draining from somewhere else. It wasn't flowing correctly—it was being pulled from other places, leaving them empty. The balance was an illusion, a temporary fix that was hiding the real problem.

*Something's not right,* you thought, but you weren't sure what. *Some places seem... emptier. Like the magic is being pulled away.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed softly, and you could feel its concern. "The magic is draining," it said, its voice worried. "It's not balanced—it's being pulled from other places. This is not a solution. This is a delay. Eventually, those places will be completely empty, and the magic will collapse."

*Oh no,* you realized. *I didn't fix it. I just moved the problem. And when it collapses, it will be worse.*

What do you do?
