# Overwhelmed Kvothe

You decided to push Kvothe to take on more than they were ready for, to give them too much responsibility too quickly. You thought they could handle it, that they were ready. You pushed them, trying to make them do more, be more, take on more.

*They can handle it,* you thought. *They're ready for more.*

But pushing Kvothe too hard only made things worse. They became overwhelmed, unable to handle the responsibility, unable to cope. They began to break down, to lose themselves, to lose the magic.

*Maybe I pushed too hard,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its sadness. "You pushed Kvothe too hard," it said, its voice sad. "You gave them too much responsibility too quickly, but growth takes time. It requires patience, understanding, gradual increase. You pushed too hard, and Kvothe became overwhelmed, losing themselves, losing the magic."

*I pushed too hard,* you realized. *I gave them too much, and I lost them. I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but Kvothe remains overwhelmed—unable to handle the responsibility, unable to grow, a reminder that growth takes time, that patience is more important than pushing, that gradual increase is the only way to truly help someone grow.
