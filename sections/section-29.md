# Opening Together

You looked at Kvothe, at the hope in their eyes, and you knew what you had to do. "Together," you said, holding out your hand. "We'll do this together. The vault was meant to be opened, and we'll open it the right way—with both of us working as one."

Kvothe's hand met yours, and immediately, you felt a connection—not just physical, but something deeper. It was like your Christmas spirit and their understanding of the vault were combining, creating something stronger than either could be alone.

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed brighter in your other hand, its light joining with the warmth that flowed between you and Kvothe. "Yes," it whispered. "This is how it's meant to be. The vault responds to unity, to shared purpose. Together, you can guide the magic safely back into the world."

You both stepped forward, placing your free hands on the stone archway. The moment your palms touched the cold stone, the carvings erupted with light—not a chaotic burst, but a steady, controlled glow that spread outward like ripples on water. The scenes of Christmas came to life, but this time, they didn't just show memories—they showed possibilities. Trees being decorated in homes you'd never seen. Gifts being given to people you'd never met. Families coming together, their laughter echoing through the clearing.

*This is what Christmas magic really is,* you realized. *It's not just about one person's joy. It's about everyone's joy, all connected, all flowing together.*

The magic began to flow from the vault, but it didn't rush out chaotically. Instead, it moved like a gentle river, streams of light that Kvothe helped guide, that you helped direct, that the Keepsake Keeper helped stabilize. The magic knew where to go—back to Starlight Hollow, back to the world, back to every place where Christmas spirit still flickered, waiting to be rekindled.

You could see it happening in real time. The trees around the clearing began to sparkle, their branches reaching toward the sky as if greeting an old friend. The snow glowed with an inner light, each flake catching and reflecting the magic. And in the distance, the lights of Starlight Hollow brightened, one by one, like stars being lit in the night sky.

*It's working,* you thought. *It's really working.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes wide with wonder. "I can feel it," they said, their voice filled with awe. "The magic is flowing back. The forest is coming alive again."

Kvothe looked at you, their expression transformed. The coldness was completely gone, replaced with something warm and bright. "Thank you," they said. "I thought I was protecting the world by locking the magic away. But you showed me that the real protection comes from sharing it, from letting it flow freely."

The Keepsake Keeper's light was almost blinding now, but you could feel its joy, its relief. "The magic is restored," it said. "But this is only the beginning. The magic has been gone for so long—bringing it back will create ripples, changes. The world will need time to adjust."

*Ripples? Changes?* you thought. *What does that mean?*

What do you do?
