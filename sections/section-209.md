# Forced Role

You decided to tell Kvothe what their new role should be, to define it for them, to make them fit into a box. You didn't let them discover it themselves, didn't give them the freedom to choose. You just told them what they should be.

*I know what they should be,* you thought. *I'll tell them, and they'll do it.*

But forcing a role on Kvothe only made things worse. They felt trapped, controlled, unable to be themselves. They began to resist, to push back, to reject the role you'd forced on them.

*Maybe I should have let them discover it themselves,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its disappointment. "You forced a role on Kvothe," it said, its voice sad. "You didn't let them discover it themselves, didn't give them freedom to choose. But transformation requires freedom, requires discovery, requires choice. You forced it, and Kvothe rejected it, rejecting you, rejecting the magic."

*I forced it,* you realized. *I told them what they should be, and I lost them. I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but Kvothe remains lost—unable to find their purpose, unable to transform, a reminder that freedom is more important than control, that discovery is more important than definition, that choice is the only way to truly find one's purpose.
