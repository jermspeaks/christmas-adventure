# Following Yuzu

Yuzu trotted away from the Christmas tree, his little paws padding softly across the worn wooden floor. He looked back at you once, twice, as if making sure you were following, then disappeared around a corner into the deeper recesses of Tombs and Trinkets.

*Well, when a dog with a red bow collar wants you to follow him, you follow him,* you thought. *That's just good sense.*

You followed Yuzu past the fantasy section, past the mystery novels (which, in hindsight, felt like foreshadowing you should have noticed), and into a narrow hallway you'd never noticed before. The hallway led to a small office, its door slightly ajar. The warm, cozy atmosphere of the bookshop seemed to fade here, replaced by something heavier, something wrong.

Yuzu stopped at the doorway and whined softly—a sound that was nothing like his cheerful greeting from moments before. His tail had stopped wagging, and he looked up at you with worried eyes.

*Oh no,* you thought. *This doesn't feel right at all.*

You pushed the door open slowly, and that's when you saw her.

Eleanor Hartwell, the owner of Tombs and Trinkets, was lying on the floor behind her desk. Her silver hair, usually perfectly coiffed, was disheveled, and her reading glasses had fallen to the floor beside her. The Christmas sweater she'd been wearing—a cheerful red knit with tiny book ornaments—was stained dark in a way that made your stomach turn.

*This is real. This is actually happening.* You'd read enough mysteries to know what you were looking at, but nothing could have prepared you for the reality of it.

Yuzu nudged something with his nose—a small, torn piece of paper that had been partially hidden under the desk. You knelt down, your hands shaking slightly, and picked it up. It was a fragment of what looked like a note, with only a few words visible: "...before Christmas Eve or else..."

*Before Christmas Eve or else what?* You turned the paper over, but the other side was blank. Yuzu whined again and pawed at something else—a small, ornate letter opener with an ivory handle, its blade dark with something that definitely wasn't ink.

What do you do?
