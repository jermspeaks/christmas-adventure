# Returning with Kvothe

"Come back to Starlight Hollow with me," you said. "The people there need help, and you understand magic better than anyone. Together, we can help the magic find balance."

Kvothe looked at you, their expression thoughtful. "I'm still figuring out who I am now," they said. "But you're right—I do understand magic. And if people need help, I want to be there."

They stood up, and you saw determination in their eyes. "Let's go," they said. "The magic needs guidance, and the people need help. We can do this together."

You made your way back to Starlight Hollow, Kvothe walking beside you. The path felt different with them there—the chaotic magic seemed to respond to their presence, becoming slightly more stable, slightly more predictable.

*They have a connection to the magic,* you realized. *Even transformed, they still understand it in a way I don't.*

As you approached Starlight Hollow, you could see the chaos was still happening—lights flickering, objects floating, trees growing and shrinking. But now, with Kvothe beside you, you felt more confident. *We can fix this,* you thought. *Together, we can help the magic find balance.*

Cheshire trotted forward to meet you, their expression relieved. "You found Kvothe," they said. "Good. We need all the help we can get."

The townspeople looked up as you approached, their expressions a mixture of hope and uncertainty. Elara stepped forward, Maya holding her hand. "You're back," she said. "And you brought help?"

Kvothe stepped forward, and you could see the townspeople's eyes widen. They recognized Kvothe—not as the shadowy guardian they might have heard about, but as someone who understood magic, someone who could help.

"The magic is trying to restore itself," Kvothe explained. "But the world has changed. Some places remember Christmas traditions and are pulling in too much magic. Others have forgotten and are getting nothing. We need to help the magic find balance—not by forcing it, but by guiding it."

*They understand the problem,* you thought. *And they want to help. Together, we can fix this.*

What do you do?
