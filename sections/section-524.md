# Too Reckless

You continued rushing ahead, thinking speed was everything, that you could handle whatever you found. You charged into the village, not paying attention, not thinking, just moving fast.

*Speed is everything,* you thought. *I need to move fast.*

But your recklessness was causing problems. You were making mistakes. You were missing important details. You were putting yourself in danger.

*This isn't working,* you thought, but you kept rushing anyway.

Cheshire tried to catch up, their expression worried. "You're being too reckless!" they called. "You need to slow down! You're making mistakes!"

*Maybe they're right,* you thought. *Maybe I am being too reckless.*

What do you do?
