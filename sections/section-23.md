# The Investigation Begins

You found your phone in your pocket, your fingers fumbling as you dialed 911. The operator's voice was calm and professional, asking questions you answered automatically while your mind raced. *Eleanor Hartwell. Murdered. In her own bookshop. Three days before Christmas.*

*This can't be real,* you kept thinking, but Yuzu's presence—his warm body pressed against your leg, his soft whine—kept you grounded. He hadn't left your side since you'd found Eleanor, and you were grateful for it.

The police arrived quickly, their presence making the cozy bookshop feel suddenly official and cold. But before they could secure the scene completely, you'd already noticed things. The office was neat, almost too neat, except for the obvious. Eleanor's desk calendar was open to December 22nd, with several appointments crossed out. A half-finished cup of tea sat on the corner of her desk, still warm to the touch.

*Someone was here recently. Very recently.*

As the police began their work, you found yourself talking to the people who'd been in the shop. Marcus Chen, Eleanor's assistant manager, was pale and shaken. He'd been working in the rare books section when it happened, he said, cataloging a new acquisition. His hands trembled as he spoke, and you noticed a fresh paper cut on his thumb.

"I can't believe this," he kept saying. "Eleanor was... she was like family. Who would do this?"

Then there was Beatrice Morrison, a regular customer who'd been browsing the mystery section (the irony wasn't lost on you). She was in her sixties, with perfectly styled gray hair and a cashmere coat that probably cost more than your entire wardrobe. She'd been there for over an hour, she said, looking for the perfect gift for her book club.

"I saw Eleanor earlier," Beatrice said, her voice crisp and precise. "She seemed perfectly fine. A bit stressed, perhaps, but that's normal this time of year."

You also met Officer Sarah Martinez, the detective who'd been assigned to the case. She was young, maybe in her early thirties, with sharp eyes that missed nothing. "I understand you found the body," she said, her tone professional but not unkind. "And the dog led you here?"

"Yuzu," you said, and the dog in question looked up at the sound of his name, his tail giving a tentative wag. "He found the note. And the letter opener."

Officer Martinez made a note. "We'll need to talk to everyone who was in the shop. But I have to ask—what were you doing here? And why did you follow the dog?"

*Good question,* you thought. *Why did I follow the dog?* But you had, and now you were here, and something about the whole situation felt like it wasn't over yet.

What do you do?
