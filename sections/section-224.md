# Control Attempt

You decided to try to control all the magic yourself to ensure balance, to be in charge of everything. You thought you could do it better, that you knew what was best. You tried to control it all.

*I can control it all,* you thought. *I know what's best.*

But trying to control all the magic only made it rebel. It rejected you, refusing to respond, becoming permanently unstable. The balance was lost forever.

*I tried to control it all,* you realized. *I lost everything.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You tried to control all the magic," it said, its voice sad. "But magic cannot be controlled. It must be shared, balanced, connected. You tried to control it all, and it rebelled, becoming permanently unstable. The balance is lost forever."

*I tried to control it all,* you realized. *I lost the balance forever.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains unstable—permanently, a reminder that control is not the answer, that sharing is more important than controlling.
