# Magic Rejection

You decided to try to hoard magic for yourself, to control it better, to make sure you had enough power. You reached out, trying to pull the magic toward you, trying to gather it, to keep it for yourself.

*If I have enough magic,* you thought, *I can control it. I can make it work the way I want it to.*

But the magic resisted. It didn't want to be hoarded, didn't want to be controlled. It pulled away from you, rejecting you, refusing to respond to your call.

*No,* you thought. *I need it. I need the magic.*

You tried harder, pulling, gathering, hoarding. But the magic only pulled away more, rejecting you completely. It stopped responding to you entirely, cutting you off, locking you out.

*What's happening?* you thought. *Why won't it respond?*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel it pulling away from you too. "The magic has rejected you," it said, its voice sad. "You tried to hoard it, to control it, to keep it for yourself. But magic is meant to be shared, to be connected, to flow freely. It cannot be hoarded, cannot be controlled. It has rejected you, and it will not respond to you again."

*No,* you thought. *This can't be happening.*

But it was. The magic had rejected you completely, permanently. You were locked out, cut off, unable to use magic, unable to help, unable to do anything. The magic continued to flow, but it flowed around you, ignoring you, rejecting you.

*I tried to hoard it,* you realized. *I tried to control it, and I lost it. I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—flowing freely, shared, connected, a reminder that magic cannot be hoarded, that control is not the same as connection, that sharing is the only way to truly have magic.
