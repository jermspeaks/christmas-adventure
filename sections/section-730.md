# Understanding the Past

You sat beside Kvothe, asking them to tell you more about their past, about what had led them here. "What happened?" you asked gently. "What made you decide to lock the magic away?"

Kvothe was silent for a long moment, and you could see the pain in their eyes, the weight of memories they'd been carrying. "I was a child when the magic started to fade," they said, their voice soft. "My parents were so disappointed. They'd always believed that Christmas magic would last forever, that it would always be there, bringing joy and wonder. But when it started to fade, they felt... betrayed. Like they'd been lied to."

*Oh,* you thought. *It wasn't just about their own disappointment. It was about their parents' disappointment, about seeing the people they loved hurt.*

"My mother stopped singing carols," Kvothe continued. "My father stopped decorating the tree. The house that had always been full of warmth and joy became... empty. Cold. And I thought... I thought it was my fault. That if I could just lock the magic away, protect it, then maybe it wouldn't fade. Maybe it wouldn't disappoint anyone."

*They were trying to protect people,* you realized. *They were trying to prevent the disappointment they'd seen, the pain they'd experienced. But in doing so, they locked away the joy too.*

"You were trying to protect people," you said. "But you ended up protecting them from joy, not just from disappointment. And that's worse. So much worse."

Kvothe looked at you, and you saw tears in their eyes. "I know that now," they said. "But at the time, I thought I was helping. I thought I was preventing the pain. But I was just... prolonging it. Making it worse."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly, and you felt its warmth, its understanding. "Pain is part of life," it said. "But so is joy. You can't protect people from one without also protecting them from the other. The magic isn't about avoiding disappointment—it's about finding joy even when things aren't perfect."

*So they understand now,* you thought. *They understand what they did, why they did it, and why it was wrong. That understanding will help their transformation.*

What do you do?
