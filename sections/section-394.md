# Character Resolutions

Everyone found their resolution. Kael was fully transformed, the guardian of balanced magic, helping magic flow, helping people find joy. Lumina was content, connected, part of the magic, part of the world. The Memory Keeper was fulfilled, its purpose complete, its light steady and strong. The community was flourishing, connected, understanding, sharing.

*Everyone found their resolution,* you thought, looking around at everyone. *Kael is transformed. Lumina is content. The Memory Keeper is fulfilled. The community is flourishing. Everyone is where they should be.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed warmly. "Everyone has found their resolution," it said, its voice filled with satisfaction. "Kael is transformed. Lumina is content. I am fulfilled. The community is flourishing. Everyone is where they should be, doing what they should be doing."

*Everyone is where they should be,* you realized. *Doing what they should be doing. This is how it should be.*

The story continues, leading to the ultimate true ending.
