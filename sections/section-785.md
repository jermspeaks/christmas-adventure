# Focused on Home

You turned away from the global view, your attention pulled back to Starlight Hollow. *The local problems need fixing first,* you thought. *I can see what's happening here. I can help the people I know. Once Starlight Hollow is stable, then I can think about the wider world.*

The journey back felt shorter than it should have, as if the magic itself was pulling you home. The streams of light that had been flowing outward seemed to slow, to hesitate, as if waiting for direction. But you didn't notice. You were focused on what you could see—the flickering lights in Starlight Hollow, the confusion in the streets, the people who needed help right now.

*They need me,* you thought. *I can fix this. I can make Starlight Hollow right again.*

When you arrived, the problems were immediate and obvious. Elara's bakery had cookies floating in mid-air. Maya's toy was still hovering near the ceiling. The streetlamps were flickering wildly, some too bright, others completely dark. The townspeople gathered around you, their faces full of hope and worry.

"We're so glad you're back," Elara said, relief in her voice. "The magic is here, but it's not working right. Can you help us fix it?"

*Of course I can,* you thought. *This is what I need to do. Fix Starlight Hollow, make it right, then everything else will follow.*

You threw yourself into solving the local problems. You helped redistribute the magic in the bakery, guided the streetlamps to steady their glow, worked with the townspeople to balance the magic flow in their homes. The Keepsake Keeper pulsed in your hands, responding to your focus, and you could feel the magic settling, finding balance, creating harmony in Starlight Hollow.

*It's working,* you thought, watching as the lights steadied, as the floating objects settled, as the magic found its rhythm in the village. *Starlight Hollow is being restored. This is good.*

Days passed, and Starlight Hollow became a beacon of Christmas magic. The lights glowed steadily, the decorations sparkled, the air itself seemed to shimmer with joy. The townspeople celebrated, and you felt proud. *I did it,* you thought. *I restored the magic to Starlight Hollow.*

But then, one evening, you stood at the edge of the village and looked out at the world beyond. The streams of magic that had been flowing outward had stopped. They had gathered around Starlight Hollow, drawn by your focus, by your attention, by the way you'd channeled all your energy into fixing this one place.

*The magic isn't spreading,* you realized, a cold feeling settling in your stomach. *It's all here, in Starlight Hollow. The rest of the world...*

Cheshire trotted up beside you, their eyes sad. "The magic responded to your focus," they said quietly. "You concentrated everything here, and the magic followed. It's beautiful in Starlight Hollow, but... the rest of the world is still waiting."

The Keepsake Keeper's light pulsed softly in your hands. "The magic is restored to Starlight Hollow," it said. "But not to the wider world. The magic flowed back to the village, but it didn't spread. The rest of the world remains without magic."

*I should have ensured it spread,* you thought, looking out at the dark world beyond Starlight Hollow. *I should have made sure the whole world got magic back. But I was too focused on what was right in front of me.*

Starlight Hollow had magic again, bright and beautiful and full of joy. But the rest of the world remained in darkness, waiting for magic that never came.
