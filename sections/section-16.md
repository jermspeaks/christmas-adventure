# Preparing for the Journey

You decided that heading into a potentially dangerous forest without any preparation was probably not your best idea. *I've seen enough adventure stories to know how this goes,* you thought. *The unprepared hero always ends up in trouble.*

"Before we go," you said, turning to Elara, "is there anything we should know? Any supplies we might need? Any... I don't know, magical items that could help?"

Elara's eyes lit up. "Oh! Yes, actually. I have just the thing." They disappeared into the back of the bakery and returned with a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. "These are star cookies," they explained, unwrapping the bundle to reveal cookies shaped like stars, each one decorated with silver icing. "They're not as magical as they used to be, but they should still give you a bit of warmth and light when you need it. And they're quite tasty, which is always a bonus."

*Star cookies that provide warmth and light?* you thought. *This world is amazing.*

They also handed you a small lantern that, when you lit it, glowed with a warm, golden light. "This will help guide you through the forest," they said. "It's not as bright as it used to be, but it should be enough. And take this." They pressed a small, silver bell into your hand. "Ring it if you get lost. The sound will help Lumina find you, even in the darkest parts of the forest."

Lumina looked pleased. "Good thinking," they said. "The forest can be disorienting, especially now that the magic is so thin. Having a way to find each other is important."

You packed the supplies carefully—the star cookies in a small pouch, the lantern hanging from your belt, the bell tucked safely in your pocket. The Memory Keeper ornament you held in your hand, its light still pulsing gently.

"One more thing," Elara said, their expression serious. "The forest has changed. The magic there has been twisted, turned against itself. You might encounter... obstacles. Things that don't want you to reach the vault. But remember—the magic responds to genuine Christmas spirit. Joy, wonder, the desire to give. If you can hold onto that, you'll be okay."

*Joy and wonder,* you thought. *In a dark, empty forest that's actively trying to make me miserable. Right. Easy.*

But you nodded, feeling more prepared than you had a moment ago. "Thank you," you said. "For everything."

Elara smiled. "Just bring the magic back. That's all the thanks I need."

What do you do?
