# Complacency

You decided to become complacent, to assume everything would work out, to not keep working at it. You thought it was done, that you didn't need to keep trying. You became complacent.

*Everything is done,* you thought. *I don't need to keep trying.*

But becoming complacent only made the magic become taken for granted, fading away. People stopped appreciating it, and it faded completely.

*The magic is fading,* you thought. *It's going away.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You became complacent," it said, its voice sad. "But magic requires appreciation, work, connection. You became complacent, and the magic became taken for granted, fading away completely."

*I became complacent,* you realized. *I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains faded—taken for granted, gone, a reminder that complacency is dangerous, that appreciation is more important than taking things for granted.
