# Hoarded Knowledge

You decided to keep the knowledge to yourself, to not share it, to hoard it. You thought it made you special, that you should keep it for yourself. You hoarded the knowledge.

*I'll keep it for myself,* you thought. *It makes me special.*

But hoarding knowledge only made the magic fade. It required sharing, teaching, connection. Without it, the magic became weaker, fading away completely.

*The magic is fading,* you thought. *It's getting weaker.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You hoarded the knowledge," it said, its voice sad. "But magic requires sharing, teaching, connection. Without it, the magic fades. You hoarded it, and the magic faded away completely."

*I hoarded it,* you realized. *I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains faded—weakened, gone, a reminder that sharing is essential, that teaching is more important than hoarding.
