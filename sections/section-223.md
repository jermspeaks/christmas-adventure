# Rushed Process

You decided to rush the process, to make the magic learn faster, to speed things up. You didn't want to wait—you wanted results now. You rushed, trying to make everything happen faster.

*I can make it learn faster,* you thought. *I just need to rush it.*

But rushing only made things worse. The magic became unstable, unable to learn properly, unable to find balance. The process became permanently broken.

*I rushed it,* you realized. *I broke it.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You rushed the process," it said, its voice sad. "You tried to make the magic learn faster, but learning takes time. You rushed it, and it became unstable, unable to learn properly. The process is now permanently broken."

*I rushed it,* you realized. *I broke the process.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains unstable—unable to learn, unable to find balance, a reminder that rushing is not the answer, that patience is more important than speed.
