# Missing Information

You thought you had enough information and rushed ahead, confident that you knew what you needed to know. You headed toward the Frostwood Forest, following the Memory Keeper's guidance, feeling prepared and ready.

*I have everything I need,* you thought. *I can do this.*

But as you entered the forest, you began to realize something was missing. The Memory Keeper had mentioned something important, but you couldn't remember what. Lumina had warned you about something, but you hadn't paid enough attention. The villagers had told you something crucial, but you'd rushed ahead before they finished.

*What am I missing?* you thought, but you weren't sure.

The Memory Keeper's light flickered, and you heard its voice, worried. "You're missing something," it said. "Something important. Something that could make the difference between success and failure."

*What is it?* you wondered. *What did I miss?*

What do you do?
