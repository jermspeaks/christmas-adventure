# Convergence

All the true ending paths converged here. Whether you achieved true balance, helped Kvothe truly transform, found perfect flow, achieved true mastery, helped the community fully understand, or created a perfect celebration—all paths led here, to this moment of convergence.

*This is it,* you thought, looking around at everyone who had been part of this journey. *All paths led here. All the work, all the effort, all the understanding—it all led here.*

Kvothe stood beside you, fully transformed, the guardian of balanced magic. Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes bright with joy. The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly, its light steady and strong. The community was gathered, connected, understanding, flourishing.

*Everything has come together,* you realized. *All the paths, all the work, all the understanding. Everything has converged here, to this moment.*

The Keepsake Keeper's voice filled the air. "All paths have converged," it said, its voice filled with joy. "All the work, all the effort, all the understanding. Everything has led here, to this moment of true resolution."

*This is the moment,* you thought. *The moment of true resolution.*

What do you do?
