# Kvothe's Solitude

You stepped back, giving Kvothe the space they seemed to need. *Sometimes people need to process things alone,* you thought. *Maybe they'll figure it out on their own.*

You moved away from the clearing, finding a spot beneath a tree where you could still see Kvothe but wouldn't intrude. The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly in your hands, and you could feel its concern.

"They need time," you said, more to yourself than anyone. "They'll be okay."

But as the minutes passed, you began to notice something. Kvothe hadn't moved. They were still sitting in the same position, their shoulders hunched, their hands clenched. The memories that had been flickering around them earlier had faded, replaced by... nothing. Just stillness. Just emptiness.

*That's not right,* you realized. *They're not processing. They're shutting down.*

Cheshire trotted over to you, their eyes worried. "I don't think the space is helping," they said quietly. "Kvothe looks... lost. More lost than before. Sometimes people need space, but sometimes they need to know they're not alone."

You looked at Kvothe again, and you saw it—the way their shoulders were tense, the way they were holding themselves, like they were trying to disappear. Like they were trying to become the shadows again, to hide from everything they were feeling.

*I made a mistake,* you thought. *Giving them space seemed right, but maybe they needed support more than solitude.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed slightly. "Transformation is hard," it said. "Sometimes people need to process alone, but sometimes they need someone to remind them that they're not alone, that they don't have to figure it all out by themselves."

You watched Kvothe, and you could see the struggle in their posture, the way they were fighting with themselves, trying to make sense of everything without any help. *They're drowning,* you realized. *And I'm just watching.*

What do you do?
