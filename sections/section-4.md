# The End of the Path

You'd reached the end of the Tombs and Trinkets path, and before you stood a magnificent Christmas tree, decorated with ornaments that seemed to glow with their own inner light. The air smelled of pine and something else—something warm and magical that made you feel like you'd stepped into a storybook.

But it wasn't the tree that caught your attention first.

Sitting patiently at the base of the tree, tail wagging so hard his entire body wiggled with the motion, was a dog. A golden shih-tzu poodle mix with the brightest, cheeriest face you'd ever seen. His fur was the color of honey and sunshine, and his eyes sparkled with what could only be described as pure joy. He had a little red bow tied around his collar, and when he saw you, he let out a happy little yip that sounded more like a greeting than a bark.

*Well, hello there,* you thought. *This is definitely not what I expected.*

The dog—Yuzu, you somehow knew his name was Yuzu—bounded toward you, his paws making soft thumping sounds on the floor. He circled you once, twice, then sat down and looked up at you with those bright, expectant eyes, as if he'd been waiting for you all along.

Underneath the tree, you noticed something else: a beautifully wrapped present with your name on it, and next to it, the breathing book from the mysterious shelves—the one with the cover made of living moss and twinkling lights. It seemed to pulse gently, as if it were calling to you.

What do you do?
