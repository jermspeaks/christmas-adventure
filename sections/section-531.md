# Master Understanding

You continued learning, and your understanding became masterful. You saw connections others missed, patterns others couldn't see, truths others couldn't understand.

*I understand deeply now,* you thought. *I see how everything connects, how everything works.*

Cheshire watched you, their expression impressed. "You understand," they said. "Really understand. Not just surface knowledge, but deep, masterful understanding. That will help you help better."

*I do understand,* you realized. *Deeply. Masterfully. And that understanding will make me more effective.*

You had learned enough, understood enough, to be truly helpful. Your understanding was deep, masterful, complete.

*Now I can help,* you thought. *Now I can make a real difference.*

What do you do?
