# Attempting Quick Fixes

You looked around at the immediate problems—the floating toy, the flickering lights, the growing tree—and you decided to act. *I can fix these,* you thought. *I have the Keepsake Keeper. I can use it to stabilize things, to make the magic work right.*

"Let me help," you said, stepping forward. You focused on Maya's floating toy first, holding up the Keepsake Keeper and trying to channel its power to bring the toy down. The Keepsake Keeper's light brightened, and you felt its power flowing through you. The toy wobbled, dipped slightly, but then floated back up, even higher than before.

*That didn't work,* you thought. *Maybe I need to try a different approach.*

You turned to the flickering streetlamp, trying to stabilize its light. The Keepsake Keeper pulsed, and the light steadied for a moment, but then it began flickering even faster, changing colors in rapid succession.

*This is getting worse,* you realized. *I'm making things worse, not better.*

The growing tree caught your attention next. You tried to slow its growth, to make it stop expanding. But as you focused on it, another tree nearby began to shrink even faster, its lights dimming to almost nothing.

*Every time I try to fix one thing,* you thought, *something else gets worse. I'm not solving the problem—I'm just moving it around.*

Elara stepped forward, her expression kind but concerned. "I appreciate that you're trying to help," she said. "But it seems like every time you fix one thing, another problem appears. Maybe... maybe we need to understand what's causing all of this before we try to fix it?"

Cheshire trotted over, their expression thoughtful. "The magic is connected," they said. "You can't fix one part without affecting the others. You need to understand the whole system before you can balance it."

*They're right,* you realized. *I'm treating symptoms, not the disease. I need to understand why the magic is behaving this way before I can fix it.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly in your hands. "The magic is responding to something deeper," it said. "You need to understand what that is before you can guide it. Trying to force it, trying to fix things without understanding... it only makes things worse."

*I need to step back,* you thought. *I need to understand the root cause, not just fix the symptoms.*

What do you do?
