# Lost Direction

You decided to let Kael take the lead completely, to step back, to let them make all the decisions. You thought they needed to be in charge, that you should follow. You stepped back, letting Kael lead, but they weren't ready.

*They should be in charge,* you thought. *I'll just follow.*

But letting Kael lead when they weren't ready only made things worse. They became overwhelmed, lost, unable to make decisions. The magic became unstable, unbalanced, dangerous.

*Maybe I should have helped more,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its disappointment. "You stepped back too far," it said, its voice sad. "You let Kael lead when they weren't ready, but partnership requires balance, requires both people contributing. You stepped back, and Kael became overwhelmed, the magic became unstable, everything fell apart."

*I stepped back too far,* you realized. *I let them lead when they weren't ready, and I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but the partnership remains unbalanced—unable to work together, unable to find balance, a reminder that partnership requires both people contributing, that balance is more important than letting one person do everything, that working together is the only way to truly succeed.
