# Deep Understanding

You continued observing and learning, and your understanding deepened. You began to see connections you hadn't noticed before, patterns that were hidden, truths that were obscured.

*I'm understanding more,* you thought. *I'm seeing connections. This is good.*

Cheshire watched you, their expression thoughtful. "You're learning," they said. "Really learning. Not just surface knowledge, but deep understanding. That's important."

*I am learning,* you realized. *Deeply. And that understanding will help me help better.*

You continued learning, and your understanding continued to deepen. You saw how everything connected, how the magic worked, how the world functioned.

*This understanding will help,* you thought. *It will make me more effective.*

What do you do?
