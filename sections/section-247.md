# Solo Solution

You decided to try to solve everything yourself, to not work with others, to do it alone. You thought you could handle it, that you didn't need help. You tried to do it alone.

*I can do it alone,* you thought. *I don't need help.*

But trying to solve everything alone only made things worse. You became overwhelmed, unable to handle it all. Everything fell apart, and there was no way to fix it.

*I can't handle it all,* you thought. *Everything is falling apart.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You tried to do it alone," it said, its voice sad. "But problems require working together, connection, support. You tried alone, and became overwhelmed, everything fell apart."

*I tried alone,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the problems remain—unsolved, overwhelming, a reminder that working together is essential, that connection is more important than doing it alone.
