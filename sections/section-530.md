# New Perspective

You tried this new approach, and it revealed something. A new perspective, a new understanding, a new way of seeing things.

*This is revealing something,* you thought. *This new perspective is showing me things I didn't see before.*

The Memory Keeper's light pulsed, and you felt something shift. The new perspective felt right, felt like it was revealing truth.

*This feels right,* you thought. *This perspective is helping me understand.*

What do you do?
