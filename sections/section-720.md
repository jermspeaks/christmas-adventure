# Supporting Transformation

You stayed with Kvothe, focusing on helping them adjust, on supporting their transformation. *They need me,* you thought. *They're going through so much change. I should be here for them.*

You watched as Kvothe processed everything—their memories, their transformation, their new role. You helped them understand, supported them, guided them. And slowly, they began to adjust, to understand who they were now, what their role was.

*This is good,* you thought. *They're adjusting. They're understanding. They're becoming who they're meant to be.*

But as time passed, you began to hear things. Shouts from Starlight Hollow. Confusion. The sound of things happening that shouldn't be happening. But you stayed with Kvothe, focusing on their needs, their transformation.

*I should check on that,* you thought. *But Kvothe needs me. They're still adjusting. I can't leave them.*

Cheshire trotted over to you, their eyes concerned. "Kvothe is adjusting," they said. "But there are problems in Starlight Hollow. The magic is unbalanced, people are confused, things are happening that need attention. You can't ignore those problems, even if Kvothe needs support."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "Supporting Kvothe is important," it said. "But so is addressing the problems that are arising. The magic needs balance, people need guidance, and the world needs help adjusting. You can't focus only on one thing—you need to balance supporting Kvothe with addressing the problems."

*So I need to find balance,* you thought. *I need to support Kvothe, but I also need to address the problems. I can't ignore one for the other—I need to do both.*

You looked at Kvothe, at their transformation, at their need for support. But you also heard the problems, the confusion, the need for help. *I need to find a way to do both,* you realized. *To support Kvothe and address the problems.*

What do you do?
