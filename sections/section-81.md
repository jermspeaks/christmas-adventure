# Letting the Professionals Handle It

"You're right," you said to Marcus. "You need to tell the police. But I'm not the one you should be confessing to. This needs to be done properly."

Marcus looked at you, his expression a mix of fear and relief. "I know," he said. "I know I do."

You stood up and found Officer Martinez, who was still in the office area, coordinating with her team. "Officer Martinez," you said. "I need to speak with you. Marcus wants to make a statement."

Officer Martinez's expression became serious. "What kind of statement?"

"He's ready to talk," you said. "But I think this should be done properly. With a lawyer present, if he wants one. With everything documented correctly."

Officer Martinez nodded. "You're right. We'll handle this the right way. Thank you for bringing this to me."

You watched as Officer Martinez approached Marcus, speaking to him in a calm, professional manner. She read him his rights, asked if he wanted a lawyer, and then began the formal process of taking his statement.

*This is how it should be done,* you thought. *Properly. Professionally. With all the safeguards in place.*

Yuzu sat beside you, watching the scene unfold. He looked up at you, his tail giving a soft wag, as if he understood that you'd done the right thing.

The process took time. Marcus was taken to the station for formal questioning. The evidence was gathered and documented properly. Everything was done by the book, exactly as it should be.

A few days later, Officer Martinez called you. "Marcus has been formally charged," she said. "He's confessed, and we've verified all the evidence. The button, the handwriting, the financial records—it all checks out. The case is solid."

*So it's done,* you thought. *The case is solved. Justice will be served.*

But as you hung up the phone, you realized that this wasn't just about solving a case. It was about doing things the right way. About letting the professionals do their job. About understanding that finding the truth was important, but finding it properly was just as important.

The police investigation was complete. Marcus had been arrested and charged. The evidence was overwhelming, and justice would be served.

You'd done it. You'd solved the case. You'd found the truth.

But as you thought about everything that had happened, you realized that the story wasn't over yet. There were still questions to answer, still reflections to make, still consequences to face.
