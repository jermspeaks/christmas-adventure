# The Guide Appears

You decided you needed someone to help you understand what was happening. "I'd like to meet a guide," you called out into the twilight air, feeling slightly ridiculous talking to what seemed like empty space.

*This is definitely the weirdest thing I've ever done,* you thought. *And that's saying something.*

Almost immediately, a figure materialized from the shadows between two cottages. At first, you thought it was a person, but as they stepped into the starlight, you realized they were something else entirely—a creature that looked like a cross between a fox and a cat, with fur the color of autumn leaves and eyes that sparkled with ancient wisdom and gentle humor.

"Ah, you called for a guide!" they said, their voice warm and musical, like wind chimes on a breezy day. "I'm Lumina, and I've been waiting for someone like you to arrive. Though I must say, you're cutting it rather close—Christmas Eve is only three days away, and the magic has been fading faster than we expected."

Lumina trotted closer, their tail swishing with a grace that suggested they'd been doing this for a very long time. They sat down in the snow, which didn't seem to bother them at all, and looked up at you with those knowing eyes.

"Let me guess," Lumina said, a hint of amusement in their voice. "You have questions. Everyone does when they first arrive. The good news is, I'm here to answer them. The less good news is that we don't have much time, so we'll need to be efficient about this."

They tilted their head, studying you. "But first, I should probably explain what's happening. The magic of this world—the very essence that makes Christmas possible—is being stolen. Not all at once, mind you. It's been happening gradually, like someone's been siphoning it away bit by bit. And now, with Christmas so close, we're running out of time to restore it."

Lumina's expression grew more serious, though their tone remained warm. "If we don't find where the magic is going and stop it, Christmas will simply... fade. Not just here, but everywhere. The joy, the wonder, the warmth—all of it will disappear."

What do you do?
