# Confronting Marcus with Evidence

You had all the pieces now. The silver button that matched Marcus's cardigan. The inconsistencies in his alibi. The evidence that he'd been stealing rare books. The letter from Alistair that proved Marcus had been caught.

*It all points to Marcus,* you thought.

You found Marcus in the café area, sitting alone at a table, looking more nervous than ever. Yuzu stayed close to you, watching Marcus with those bright, intelligent eyes.

"Marcus," you said, sitting down across from him. "I need to talk to you."

Marcus looked up, his expression guarded. "What about?"

"I know what happened," you said. "I know you killed Eleanor."

Marcus's face went white. "What? No. I didn't—"

"I have evidence," you said. "The silver button from your cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk. Your alibi doesn't hold up—there's no evidence you were working in the rare books section. And I found a letter from Alistair Finch, proving that you'd been stealing rare books and that Eleanor was going to find out."

Marcus was silent for a long moment. Then he said, "You don't understand. It wasn't like that. I didn't mean to—"

*So he's going to confess?* you thought. *Or is he going to try to explain it away?*

"What happened?" you asked.

Marcus's hands were shaking. "Eleanor found out. About the books. She confronted me. We argued. I... I panicked. I grabbed the letter opener, and... I didn't mean to kill her. It just happened."

*So it was a crime of passion,* you thought. *He didn't plan it. But that doesn't make it any less wrong.*

"You need to tell the police," you said. "You need to confess."

Marcus looked at you, his eyes full of fear and regret. "I know," he said. "I know I do. But I'm scared. What's going to happen to me?"

*That's not your problem to solve,* you thought. *You've found the truth. Now justice needs to be served.*

What do you do?
