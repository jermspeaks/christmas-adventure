# Suppressed Magic

You worked with the magic, and it seemed to stabilize. The chaos in Starlight Hollow stopped. The lights stopped flickering wildly. The trees stopped growing and shrinking. Everything seemed... normal. Balanced. Fixed.

*It worked,* you thought, relief flooding through you. *The magic is balanced. Everything is fixed.*

But as time passed, you began to notice something. The magic wasn't really balanced—it was suppressed. It wasn't flowing freely—it was being held back, contained, controlled. The balance was an illusion, a temporary fix that was hiding the real problem.

*Something's not right,* you thought, but you weren't sure what. *The magic seems... quiet. Too quiet.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed softly, and you could feel its concern. "The magic is suppressed," it said, its voice worried. "It's not balanced—it's being held back. This is not a solution. This is a delay. The magic will eventually break free, and when it does, it will be worse than before."

*Oh no,* you realized. *I didn't fix it. I just suppressed it. And when it breaks free, it will be worse.*

What do you do?
