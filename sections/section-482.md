# Local Restoration

You restored the magic to Starlight Hollow, but not to the wider world. The magic flowed back to the village, bringing joy and wonder to the people there, but it didn't spread beyond. The rest of the world remained without magic.

*Starlight Hollow has magic again,* you thought, satisfaction mixed with concern. *But the rest of the world doesn't.*

The Memory Keeper's light pulsed softly. "The magic is restored to Starlight Hollow," it said. "But not to the wider world. The magic flowed back to the village, but it didn't spread. The rest of the world remains without magic."

*I should have ensured it spread,* you thought. *I should have made sure the whole world got magic back.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—restored locally, but not globally, a reminder that local success is good, but global success is better, that spreading magic is important, that the whole world matters.
