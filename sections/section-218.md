# Ignored Danger

You decided to ignore the dangerous magic buildup, to focus on the empty places instead. You thought the buildup wasn't that dangerous, that you could deal with it later. You ignored it, focusing on other things.

*It's not that dangerous,* you thought. *I'll deal with it later.*

But ignoring the danger only made things worse. The magic buildup grew, becoming more unstable, more dangerous. Eventually, it exploded, destroying everything in its path.

*I should have dealt with it,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You ignored the danger," it said, its voice sad. "You thought it wasn't that dangerous, but magic buildup is always dangerous. You ignored it, and it exploded, destroying everything."

*I ignored it,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the region remains destroyed—a reminder that ignoring danger doesn't make it go away, that addressing problems is more important than avoiding them.
