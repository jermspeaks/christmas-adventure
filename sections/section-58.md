# Beatrice and Eleanor's Friendship

You asked Beatrice about her relationship with Eleanor, and her expression softened. "We've been friends for twenty years," she said. "We met when I first started coming to the shop. Eleanor was always so kind, so welcoming. She helped me find the perfect books for my book club. We'd have tea together sometimes, talk about books, about life."

*Twenty years,* you thought. *That's a long friendship. Would someone kill a friend of twenty years?*

"But recently?" you asked. "How was your relationship recently? Was everything okay between you?"

Beatrice hesitated. "We... we had a disagreement. A few weeks ago. About a book. I wanted to buy it, but Eleanor wouldn't sell it. She said it was part of her personal collection, not for sale. I was upset. I thought, after all these years, she could make an exception. But she wouldn't."

*So there was tension,* you thought. *But was it enough to lead to murder? Probably not.*

"What book was it?" you asked.

"A first edition of *The Great Gatsby*," Beatrice said. "It was beautiful. I wanted it so badly. But Eleanor wouldn't sell it. She said it was special to her, that it had been a gift."

*Interesting,* you thought. *But still, that doesn't seem like a motive for murder.*

*Unless there was something more,* you thought. *Unless the disagreement was about something else entirely.*

What do you do?
