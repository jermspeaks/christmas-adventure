# The Test

You thought the guardian was convinced, that they believed you, that they were ready to help. You saw their expression soften, their resistance fade, their willingness to cooperate.

*They're convinced,* you thought. *They're ready to help.*

But as you tried to open the Memory Vault, you realized something was wrong. The guardian's expression shifted, their resistance returned, their cooperation disappeared. They stepped back, their eyes cold again, their determination renewed.

*What happened?* you thought. *I thought they were convinced.*

The guardian looked at you, their expression disappointed. "You thought I was convinced," they said. "But I was testing you. I wanted to see if you truly understood, if you were truly ready. And you're not. You're not ready, and you don't understand."

*I failed the test,* you realized. *They were testing me, and I failed.*

What do you do?
