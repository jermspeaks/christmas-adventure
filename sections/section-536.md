# Deeper Truth

You continued exploring this perspective, and it revealed even deeper truth. More important truth, more essential truth, truth that went even deeper.

*There's even deeper truth,* you thought. *More important, more essential.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light brightened, and you felt the deeper truth settling in. This perspective was revealing something even more important, even more essential.

*This deeper truth is even more important,* you realized. *Even more essential.*

What do you do?
