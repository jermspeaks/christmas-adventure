# Tracing the Button

You held the silver button carefully, examining it. It was small, decorative, the kind of button you might find on a nice coat or a cardigan. Yuzu had found it near Eleanor's desk, caught in the fibers of the rug.

*This is important,* you thought. *This could be the physical evidence that connects someone to the scene.*

You thought about who you'd seen wearing clothing with buttons. Marcus had been wearing a cardigan—dark gray with silver buttons. You'd noticed one of the buttons was loose, the thread visible.

*Could this be Marcus's button?* you wondered.

But Velma had been wearing a cashmere coat. You hadn't noticed if it had buttons like this, but it was possible.

*I need to find out where this button came from,* you thought.

You looked at Marcus's cardigan more carefully. Dark gray, silver buttons. One button was missing. The button you had was silver, decorative, the right size to match.

*It could be his,* you thought. *But I need to be sure.*

You also thought about the position of the button. It had been found near Eleanor's desk, caught in the rug. *If it came off during a struggle,* you thought, *then whoever was wearing it was definitely in the office. And if it's Marcus's button, then Marcus was in the office.*

*But Marcus said he wasn't in the office,* you thought. *He said he was in the rare books section the whole time.*

*So either he's lying,* you thought, *or the button belongs to someone else.*

What do you do?
