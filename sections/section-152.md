# The Root of the Problem

As you listened to the townspeople's stories, a pattern began to emerge. The places that were getting too much magic were the ones that had strong Christmas memories—the bakery that had been making cookies for generations, the tree that had been decorated the same way for years, the streetlamp that had been lit every Christmas Eve for as long as anyone could remember. The places getting too little magic were newer, or had lost their connection to Christmas traditions.

*It's about memory,* you realized. *The magic is drawn to places with strong Christmas memories, and it's avoiding places without them. But it doesn't know how to balance—it's giving everything to the places that remember, and nothing to the places that don't.*

"The magic is responding to memory," you said, understanding dawning. "Places with strong Christmas traditions are pulling in too much magic because they remember how to hold it. Places without those traditions are getting nothing because the magic doesn't recognize them."

Elara nodded slowly. "That makes sense. The bakery has been in my family for three generations. We've always made the same cookies, always decorated the same way. But the new shops on the other side of town... they don't have those memories yet."

The Memory Keeper pulsed in your hands, and you felt its warmth spreading through you. "The magic needs to learn balance," it said, its voice thoughtful. "It needs to remember that Christmas isn't just about the places that have always had it—it's about spreading joy to new places, too. But it can't do that on its own. It needs guidance."

*So we need to help the magic find balance,* you thought. *We need to show it that new places deserve magic too, and that old places don't need all of it.*

You looked around at the worried faces of the townspeople, at the chaos the unstable magic was causing, and you knew what you had to do. But how? The magic was powerful, and trying to control it directly could make things worse. You needed a way to guide it, not force it.

What do you do?
