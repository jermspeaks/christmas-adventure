# Verifying the Handwriting

You needed to be certain. The torn note was crucial evidence, but you couldn't just assume the handwriting matched. You needed professional verification.

You found Officer Martinez and showed her the torn note fragment. "I think this matches Marcus's handwriting," you said. "But I want to be sure. Can you have it analyzed?"

Officer Martinez examined the note carefully. "We can do that," she said. "We have handwriting experts who can compare it to samples. But we'll need handwriting samples from Marcus to compare it against."

You thought about what you'd seen. Marcus had been working on catalogs. There were notes in his handwriting throughout the shop. "I can help you find samples," you said. "I've seen his handwriting in the catalogs he's been working on."

Together, you and Officer Martinez gathered handwriting samples from Marcus's work—catalogs, notes, inventory lists. You also found the letter from Alistair that Marcus had intercepted, and you compared the handwriting on the torn note to everything you could find.

*It looks the same,* you thought, comparing the sharp, angular letters. *But I need to be certain.*

Officer Martinez sent the samples to the lab for analysis. It took a few days, but when the results came back, they were definitive. The handwriting on the torn note matched Marcus's handwriting. The expert was certain.

*So it was Marcus who wrote the threatening note,* you thought. *He was trying to make it look like Alistair was the one threatening Eleanor, to throw suspicion away from himself.*

With the handwriting verified, along with the button, the financial records, and Marcus's confession, the case was complete. The evidence was overwhelming. Marcus was arrested and charged with murder.

*I was thorough,* you thought. *I verified everything. I made sure I was certain before we moved forward.*

The police investigation was complete. Marcus had been arrested and charged. The evidence was overwhelming, and justice would be served.

You'd done it. You'd solved the case. You'd found the truth.

But as you thought about everything that had happened, you realized that the story wasn't over yet. There were still questions to answer, still reflections to make, still consequences to face.
