# Places of Gathering and Avoidance

You followed the magic streams, and you began to see the places where magic was gathering and the places it was avoiding. The gathering places were overwhelming—magic so thick you could almost see it, so strong it was causing problems. Lights too bright, decorations too animated, everything too much.

The avoiding places were empty—completely devoid of magic, cold and lifeless, like Christmas had never touched them at all.

*This is the problem,* you realized. *The magic is going to the places it knows, the places it remembers, and it's avoiding the places it doesn't know. But that's not balance. That's not right.*

You approached one of the gathering places—a small town that had been celebrating Christmas for generations. The magic was so thick there that everything was glowing, everything was moving, everything was too much. A Christmas tree was growing at an alarming rate. Lights were changing colors faster than you could follow. A snowman was literally dancing in place.

*This is too much,* you thought. *The magic is overwhelming this place. It needs to share, to flow to other places.*

You then approached one of the avoiding places—a newer town, one that had been built after the magic was locked away. It was completely empty of magic, cold and lifeless. No lights, no sparkle, no warmth. Like Christmas had never been there at all.

*This is too little,* you thought. *This place needs magic too. It deserves Christmas magic, even if it doesn't have the memories yet.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed in your hands, and you could feel its concern. "The magic is unbalanced," it said. "It's remembering the old world, going to the places it knows, avoiding the places it doesn't. But the world has changed. New places need magic too. Old places don't need all of it."

*So we need to help the magic find balance,* you thought. *We need to help it understand that new places deserve magic too, and that old places don't need all of it.*

What do you do?
