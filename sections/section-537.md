# Complete Verification

You continued verifying, making absolutely sure the message was complete, that you understood everything, that nothing was missing.

*I need to be absolutely sure,* you thought. *I need to verify everything.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light pulsed, and you heard its voice, understanding. "Verification is good," it said. "But don't verify forever. At some point, you need to act."

*They're right,* you thought. *I need to verify, but I also need to act.*

What do you do?
