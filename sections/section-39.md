# Searching the Office

You forced yourself to be methodical, to search the office systematically. *I need to find everything before the police arrive,* you thought. *Before the scene gets processed, before things get moved.*

Yuzu stayed close, his warm presence a comfort as you worked. You started with Eleanor's desk, pulling open drawers carefully. The top drawer held pens, paper clips, rubber bands—normal office supplies. The second drawer held files, invoices, receipts. The third drawer was locked.

*Locked?* You tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. *What's in there?*

You moved to the filing cabinet in the corner. It was old, made of dark wood, with four drawers. You started with the top drawer—customer files, organized alphabetically. The second drawer—financial records, invoices, receipts. The third drawer—correspondence, letters, business cards.

The fourth drawer was at the bottom, and when you pulled it open, you found something unexpected. It was filled with files, but at the very back, tucked behind everything else, was a small envelope. You pulled it out carefully.

Inside was a letter, written in handwriting you didn't recognize. It was dated December 20th, just two days ago.

*Eleanor,* it read. *I know what Marcus has been doing. I can prove he's been stealing from your collection. Meet me tonight, and I'll give you all the evidence. But you have to act before Christmas Eve, or I'll take it to the authorities myself. I'm sorry it's come to this, but you deserve to know the truth.*

It was signed *Alistair Finch.*

*Alistair Finch,* you thought. *The rare book dealer whose card Yuzu found. He wasn't threatening Eleanor—he was trying to help her. He was going to give her evidence against Marcus.*

But then you noticed something else. The letter was dated December 20th. But the torn note Yuzu had found—"before Christmas Eve or else"—that had been written more recently. And the handwriting was different.

*Two different notes,* you realized. *Two different people. Or one person trying to throw suspicion elsewhere?*

What do you do?
