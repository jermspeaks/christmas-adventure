# Forced Sharing

You decided to force the magic to flow to the empty places, to make it share, to control where it went. You didn't let it learn—you forced it, trying to make it do what you wanted.

*I can make it share,* you thought. *I just need to force it.*

But forcing the magic to share only made it rebel. It became more resistant, more unstable, more dangerous. The magic flow became permanently broken.

*I forced it,* you realized. *I broke it.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You forced the magic," it said, its voice sad. "You tried to make it share, but magic must learn to share. It cannot be forced. You forced it, and it rebelled, becoming permanently broken."

*I forced it,* you realized. *I broke the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains broken—unable to share, unable to flow, a reminder that forcing is not the answer, that learning is more important than forcing.
