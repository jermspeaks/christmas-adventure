# Given Up Teaching

You decided to give up when people resisted understanding, to stop trying, to walk away. You thought it was too hard, that people didn't want to learn. You gave up.

*They don't want to learn,* you thought. *I'm giving up.*

But giving up only made the magic remain misunderstood, fading away. People never learned, and the magic faded completely.

*The magic is fading,* you thought. *It's going away.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You gave up," it said, its voice sad. "But teaching requires persistence, patience, connection. You gave up, and the magic remained misunderstood, fading away completely."

*I gave up,* you realized. *I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains misunderstood—faded, gone, a reminder that giving up is not the answer, that persistence is more important than giving up.
