# Ultimate Truth

You continued exploring, and you discovered the ultimate truth. The deepest truth, the most important truth, the truth that mattered most.

*This is the ultimate truth,* you thought. *The deepest, the most important.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light brightened completely, and you heard its voice, filled with wonder. "You've discovered it," it said. "The ultimate truth. The deepest understanding. This is what you needed to know."

*I have discovered it,* you realized. *The ultimate truth, the deepest understanding.*

You had discovered the ultimate truth, the deepest understanding, everything you needed to know.

*Now I can use this,* you thought. *Now I can help truly.*

What do you do?
