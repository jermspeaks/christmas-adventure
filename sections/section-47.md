# Confronting Marcus

You found Marcus in the rare books section, where he claimed to have been working all afternoon. But when you looked around, everything was pristine, organized, with each book carefully cataloged and displayed. There were no signs of recent work—no catalog, no notes, nothing to suggest he'd been working here.

*His alibi doesn't hold up,* you thought.

You approached him, Yuzu at your side. Marcus looked up, his expression nervous. "Can I help you?" he asked.

"I need to ask you some questions," you said. "About your alibi. You said you were working here all afternoon, cataloging a first edition of *The Maltese Falcon*?"

"Yes," Marcus said, his voice a bit too quick. "I finished it. Everything's done."

*But there's no evidence of that,* you thought. *No catalog, no notes, nothing.*

You pulled out the silver button Yuzu had found. "Do you recognize this?" you asked.

Marcus's face went pale. "I... I don't know. Where did you find it?"

"Near Eleanor's desk," you said. "It looks like it came from a cardigan. A dark gray cardigan with silver buttons. Like the one you're wearing."

Marcus's hand went to his cardigan, to where one of the buttons was missing. "I... I don't know how that got there," he said. "I wasn't in the office. I was here, working."

*But you weren't working here,* you thought. *There's no evidence of that.*

You also noticed something else. Marcus had a fresh paper cut on his thumb. *How did he get that?* you wondered. *From cataloging books? Or from something else?*

"Marcus," you said, "I think you need to tell me the truth. Where were you really this afternoon?"

Marcus's face tightened. "I told you. I was here. Working."

*But that's not true,* you thought. *And I can prove it.*

What do you do?
