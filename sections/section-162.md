# Following the Magic

You decided to follow the magic, to see where it was going, to understand how it was flowing across the world. The Memory Keeper pulsed in your hands, and you could feel it guiding you, helping you see the streams of light that flowed from the vault, spreading outward like rivers of starlight.

*It's beautiful,* you thought, watching as the magic flowed, as it spread across the world. *But where is it going? What is it doing?*

Lumina trotted beside you, their eyes bright with wonder. "I can feel it," they said. "The magic is flowing, spreading, trying to reach every place that needs it. But it's not balanced. Some places are getting too much, others too little."

You followed the streams of light, and as you walked, you began to see patterns. The magic was flowing toward places with strong Christmas memories—towns with long traditions, homes with generations of celebration, places where Christmas had always been special. But it was avoiding newer places, places without those memories, places that didn't know how to hold magic yet.

*It's like the magic is remembering the old world,* you realized. *It's going to the places it knows, the places it remembers. But the world has changed. There are new places, new people, new traditions. And they need magic too.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "The magic is trying to restore itself," it said. "But it's remembering the world as it was, not as it is. It needs to learn that the world has changed, that new places deserve magic too, that Christmas isn't just about the past—it's about the present and future too."

You continued following the magic streams, and as you walked, you began to notice something else. Some places were gathering magic, pulling it in, hoarding it. Others were empty, completely devoid of magic, like the magic was afraid to go there.

*This isn't right,* you thought. *The magic should be shared, should flow freely. It shouldn't be hoarded, and it shouldn't be avoided.*

What do you do?
