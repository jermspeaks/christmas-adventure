# Forgotten Joy

You decided to focus only on challenges and forget to celebrate, to only work, to never enjoy. You thought work was more important, that celebration was a waste of time. You forgot to celebrate.

*Work is more important,* you thought. *Celebration is a waste.*

But forgetting to celebrate only made the magic lose its joy, becoming work, burden, obligation. The magic faded, and everything became hollow.

*The magic is losing joy,* you thought. *It's becoming work.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You forgot to celebrate," it said, its voice sad. "But magic requires joy, celebration, appreciation. You forgot, and the magic lost its joy, becoming work, burden, obligation."

*I forgot,* you realized. *I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains hollow—joy lost, work only, a reminder that celebration is essential, that joy is more important than only working.
