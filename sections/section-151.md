# The People of Starlight Hollow

You approached the nearest group of townspeople, and they turned to look at you with a mixture of hope and uncertainty. The Keepsake Keeper in your hands seemed to pulse a little brighter, and you saw their eyes widen.

"You're the one," a woman said, stepping forward. She had silver hair and kind eyes, and she was holding a small child's hand. "You're the one who brought the magic back. We saw the lights, we felt it... but it's not working right, is it?"

*They know,* you realized. *They know I'm involved, and they're looking to me for answers.*

"My name is Elara," the woman continued. "This is my granddaughter, Maya. Her toy started floating this morning, and we can't get it down. It's not dangerous, but... it's not normal, either. And look around—everything's like this. Some things have too much magic, some have too little. We don't know what to do."

You looked around the square, and you could see what she meant. A bakery's display window had cookies that were literally dancing in place. A streetlamp was glowing so brightly it was casting shadows in broad daylight. But next to it, another streetlamp was completely dark, its bulb cold and lifeless.

"The magic is trying to restore itself," you explained. "But the world has changed since it was locked away. Some places remember how to hold magic, and they're taking too much. Others have forgotten, and they're getting too little. We need to help it find balance."

Cheshire trotted forward, and Maya's eyes lit up. "A talking reindeer!" she said, and Cheshire's ears perked up with pride.

"We're here to help," Cheshire said. "But we need to understand what's happening. Can you tell us about the problems you're seeing?"

Elara nodded, and other townspeople began to gather around, sharing their stories. A man whose Christmas lights wouldn't stop changing colors. A woman whose tree was growing too fast. A family whose presents were floating. Each story was different, but they all had the same root cause: magic that didn't know how much to give.

*We need to find the pattern,* you thought. *We need to understand why some things are getting too much magic and others too little.*

What do you do?
