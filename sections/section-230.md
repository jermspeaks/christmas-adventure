# Forced Connections

You decided to try to master it quickly by forcing connections, by making yourself feel things, by forcing memories. You thought you could speed it up, that you could force it to work. You forced the connections.

*I can force it to work,* you thought. *I just need to try harder.*

But forcing connections only made them fake, hollow, meaningless. The magic rejected the forced connections, cutting you off, locking you out.

*The connections are fake,* you thought. *The magic won't respond.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You forced the connections," it said, its voice sad. "But connections must be real, genuine, meaningful. Forced connections are fake, hollow. The magic rejected them, cutting you off permanently."

*I forced them,* you realized. *I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains inaccessible—rejecting fake connections, a reminder that authenticity is essential, that genuine connection is more important than forcing.
