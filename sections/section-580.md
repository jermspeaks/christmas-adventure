# Rushed Understanding

You moved closer to Kvothe, your words tumbling out faster than you intended. "You're the guardian of balanced magic now," you said. "You help magic flow, you help people find joy. You're not the guardian of shadows anymore—you're someone who helps, who guides, who—"

"Stop," Kvothe said, their voice sharp, almost panicked. "Please, just... stop."

You froze, and you saw it—the way their eyes were wide with overwhelm, the way their hands were shaking. The memories that had been flickering around them were now swirling, chaotic, too fast to process. Images of their family, their childhood, their transformation—all of it flooding in at once, too much, too fast.

*Oh no,* you thought. *I'm making it worse. I'm trying to help, but I'm just adding to the overwhelm.*

"I'm sorry," you said, stepping back. "I didn't mean to—"

"I know," Kvothe interrupted, their voice breaking. "I know you're trying to help. But it's all too much. Everything is happening at once, and I can't... I can't hold it all. I can't understand it all. Not like this."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed urgently in your hands. "Slow down," it said, its voice gentle but firm. "Understanding can't be rushed. Transformation takes time. Memories need to be processed one at a time, not all at once."

Cheshire trotted forward, their presence calming. "You're trying to help," they said to you. "But sometimes help means slowing down, not speeding up. Sometimes it means being patient, not pushing."

You looked at Kvothe, at the way they were struggling, at the way the memories were overwhelming them. *I was trying to help,* you thought. *But I was doing it wrong. I was rushing, when what they needed was patience.*

Kvothe closed their eyes, taking deep breaths. "I need... I need to go slower," they said. "One thing at a time. One memory at a time. I can't process everything at once."

*They're right,* you realized. *I need to slow down. I need to help them process, not rush them through it.*

What do you do?
