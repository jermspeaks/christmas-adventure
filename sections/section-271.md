# The Collapse

You accepted that the magic was flowing correctly, thinking everything was fixed. You celebrated, thinking the problem was solved. But the Keepsake Keeper was right—the magic was only draining, not truly balanced.

Weeks passed, and the drained places became completely empty. The magic started to collapse, pulling from everywhere, creating chaos. And then, one day, it all fell apart.

The magic collapsed completely, leaving the world without magic. Everything that had been built on magic crumbled. The world was left empty, cold, lifeless.

*I should have investigated,* you thought, watching the collapse. *I should have found the real solution. I should have truly balanced the magic.*

But it was too late. The magic was gone, and there was no way to get it back.

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—empty, cold, a reminder that false balance is not the same as true balance, that temporary fixes are not solutions, that investigating problems is more important than accepting false solutions.
