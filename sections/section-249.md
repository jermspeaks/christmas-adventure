# Broken Harmony

You decided to break the celebration harmony by forcing solutions, to make people do what you wanted, to not accept the celebration. You thought you knew what was best, that you could force it. You broke the harmony.

*I know what's best,* you thought. *I can force it.*

But breaking the harmony only made the magic lose its joy aspect, becoming hollow, meaningless. The celebration ended, and the magic faded.

*The magic is losing joy,* you thought. *It's becoming hollow.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You broke the harmony," it said, its voice sad. "But magic requires joy, celebration, togetherness. You broke it, and the magic lost its joy aspect, becoming hollow, meaningless."

*I broke the harmony,* you realized. *I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains hollow—joy lost, meaningless, a reminder that harmony is essential, that joy is more important than forcing.
