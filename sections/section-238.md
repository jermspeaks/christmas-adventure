# Overwhelmed Teaching

You decided to try to teach everyone everything at once, to not take time, to rush. You thought you could teach them all, that you could do it quickly. You rushed, trying to teach everything.

*I can teach them all,* you thought. *I just need to rush.*

But rushing only made people overwhelmed, confused, unable to learn. The teaching became ineffective, and people never really understood.

*They're overwhelmed,* you thought. *They can't learn.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You rushed," it said, its voice sad. "But teaching takes time, patience, gradual learning. You rushed, and people became overwhelmed, unable to learn. The teaching was ineffective."

*I rushed,* you realized. *I failed to teach them.*

The story ends here, but the teaching remains ineffective—people never learned, a reminder that rushing is not the answer, that patience is more important than speed.
