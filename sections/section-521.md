# Reckless Rush

You decided to rush recklessly into the village, thinking speed was more important than caution, that you could figure things out as you went. You charged forward, not paying attention to your surroundings, not thinking about consequences.

*I need to move fast,* you thought. *I don't have time to be careful.*

Cheshire tried to keep up, their expression worried. "Slow down!" they called. "You're going too fast! You're not paying attention!"

But you didn't listen. You rushed ahead, thinking you could handle whatever you found, that speed was everything, that caution was a waste of time.

*I can handle this,* you thought. *I just need to move fast.*

But as you rushed into the village, you began to realize you'd made mistakes. You'd missed important details. You'd gone the wrong way. You'd put yourself in danger.

*This was a mistake,* you realized. *I should have been more careful.*

What do you do?
