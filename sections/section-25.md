# Red Herrings

You decided to follow the most obvious lead first—Beatrice Morrison and whatever she'd slipped into her purse. It felt like the kind of thing a detective would do, and you'd read enough mysteries to know that suspicious behavior usually meant something.

You found her in the café area, sitting at a small table with a cup of tea that had gone cold. When you approached, she looked up, her expression carefully neutral.

"I saw you take something," you said, trying to sound more confident than you felt. "Earlier, when you thought no one was looking."

Beatrice's face flushed, and for a moment, you thought you'd caught her. But then she reached into her purse and pulled out a small, leather-bound book—a first edition of *Murder on the Orient Express*, its cover worn but clearly valuable.

"I was going to pay for it," she said, her voice defensive. "I always do. Eleanor knew I sometimes... borrow books to examine them more closely before purchasing. It's a habit, I know, but I always bring them back or pay for them. I have the receipt right here."

She showed you a receipt, dated that morning, for the exact book she was holding. *Well, that's embarrassing,* you thought. *So much for my detective skills.*

But Beatrice wasn't done. "I know what you're thinking," she said, her tone sharper now. "But I had nothing to do with Eleanor's death. She was my friend. We've known each other for twenty years. I was here looking for a gift for our book club's Christmas exchange, and I found her like that, just like you did."

*Wait,* you thought. *She found Eleanor? But she said she was in the mystery section the whole time.*

You asked her about it, and Beatrice's composure cracked slightly. "I... I went to the office to ask Eleanor about a book. I found her there. I panicked. I didn't know what to do, so I went back to browsing, trying to process what I'd seen. I know it sounds terrible, but I was in shock."

*That could be true,* you thought. *Or it could be a lie.*

Meanwhile, Officer Martinez had been investigating Alistair Finch, the rare book dealer whose card you'd found. She'd called his number, and it turned out he'd been trying to buy a rare collection from Eleanor for months—a collection she'd refused to sell, despite his increasingly aggressive offers.

"He has an alibi," Officer Martinez told you. "He was at an auction in the city, with dozens of witnesses. But he's been harassing Eleanor for weeks, sending threatening letters. We found more of them in her office."

*So Alistair Finch had motive,* you thought. *But he also had an alibi. And the threatening letters explained the torn note Yuzu had found.*

But something still didn't add up. The letter opener with the ivory handle—you'd noticed it before, in Eleanor's office. It was part of a set, a gift from someone. But where was the rest of the set? And why would someone use Eleanor's own letter opener to kill her?

*Unless,* you thought, *they wanted it to look like someone else did it. Or unless they didn't plan it at all.*

Yuzu nudged your hand, and you looked down to see he'd found something else—a small, silver button, caught in the fibers of the rug near Eleanor's desk. It didn't match anything Eleanor had been wearing.

*Another clue,* you thought. *But what does it mean?*

What do you do?
