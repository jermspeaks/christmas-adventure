# Reconstructing the Timeline

You sat down with a notebook, trying to piece together exactly what had happened and when. *If I can figure out the timeline,* you thought, *I can figure out who had the opportunity to kill Eleanor.*

Yuzu curled up at your feet, watching you work, as if he understood what you were doing.

*Let's start with what I know,* you told yourself. *Eleanor was killed in her office. The letter opener was hers. The torn note mentioned "before Christmas Eve or else." Someone was here, in the shop, when it happened.*

You thought about the people you'd met. Marcus said he'd been in the rare books section all afternoon, cataloging a first edition of *The Maltese Falcon*. Velma said she'd been in the mystery section for over an hour, looking for a gift. You'd arrived at the shop around... when? You checked your phone. It was 4:30 PM now. You'd been here for maybe an hour, maybe a bit more.

*So if Eleanor was killed recently,* you thought, *and the tea on her desk was still warm, then it happened within the last hour or two. Maybe even more recently.*

You thought about Eleanor's journal entry: *December 22nd: Tonight. I'll confront them tonight. It has to end.*

*She was planning to confront someone tonight,* you thought. *And now she's dead. So whoever she was going to confront—they must have killed her first.*

But who? Marcus? Velma? Someone else entirely?

You looked at Eleanor's calendar, still open on her desk. December 22nd. Several appointments crossed out. But one wasn't crossed out—a note that said "4:00 PM - Important meeting."

*4:00 PM,* you thought. *That was half an hour ago. Was that when she was killed?*

You needed to figure out where everyone was at 4:00 PM. Marcus said he was in the rare books section. Velma said she was in the mystery section. But could you verify that? Could anyone?

What do you do?
