# Over-Learning

You continued learning, thinking you needed more, that you didn't understand enough yet. You kept studying, kept observing, kept learning.

*I need to learn more,* you thought. *I don't understand enough yet.*

But as you continued learning, you began to realize you might be learning too much, spending too much time, not acting when you should.

*Am I learning too much?* you wondered. *Am I spending too much time?*

Cheshire watched you, their expression concerned. "You've learned a lot," they said. "Maybe enough. Maybe it's time to act, not just learn."

*Maybe they're right,* you thought. *Maybe I've learned enough.*

What do you do?
