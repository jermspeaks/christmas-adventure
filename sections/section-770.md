# Empty Places

You focused on the places where magic was avoiding—the newer towns, the places without Christmas memories, the places that felt cold and lifeless. *Why is the magic avoiding these places?* you wondered. *What makes them different?*

You walked through one of the empty towns, and you could feel the absence of magic. It wasn't just that there was no magic—it was that there was no connection, no memories, no sense of Christmas at all. The buildings were new, the streets were clean, but there was nothing that felt like Christmas, nothing that the magic could recognize, could connect to.

*The magic doesn't recognize these places,* you realized. *They don't have Christmas memories, so the magic doesn't know how to reach them. It's not that the magic doesn't want to go there—it's that it doesn't know how.*

You saw a family walking down the street, their expressions neutral, their pace hurried. They didn't seem to notice the absence of magic, or maybe they'd never known what it felt like to have it. *They don't have Christmas memories here,* you thought. *This place is new to them. They haven't built those connections yet.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly in your hands. "The magic needs memories to connect to," it said. "These places don't have Christmas memories yet, so the magic doesn't know how to reach them. But that doesn't mean they don't deserve magic. They just need help creating those memories, those connections."

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes thoughtful. "The magic is avoiding these places because they don't have memories to connect to," they said. "But memories can be created. Connections can be built. The magic just needs help understanding that these places deserve magic too, even if they don't have the memories yet."

*So we need to help create memories,* you thought. *We need to help these places build connections, to show the magic that they deserve Christmas magic too, even if they don't have the memories yet.*

What do you do?
