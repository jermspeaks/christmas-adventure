# Abandoned Again

You decided to abandon Kael when things got difficult, to walk away, to give up on them. You thought it was too hard, that you couldn't help them anymore. You left them alone, struggling, lost.

*I can't do this anymore,* you thought. *I'm giving up.*

But abandoning Kael only made things worse. They became completely lost, unable to find their way, unable to transform. They lost all hope, lost the magic, lost everything.

*Maybe I should have stayed,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its deep sadness. "You abandoned Kael," it said, its voice heavy with sorrow. "You gave up when things got difficult, but transformation requires persistence, requires commitment, requires not giving up. You abandoned them, and they became completely lost, losing all hope, losing the magic, losing everything."

*I abandoned them,* you realized. *I gave up, and I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but Kael remains abandoned—completely lost, unable to find their way, a reminder that persistence is more important than giving up, that commitment is more important than walking away, that not giving up is the only way to truly help someone transform.
