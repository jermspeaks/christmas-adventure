# True Balance

You worked patiently, carefully, and the magic found true balance. It wasn't just stable—it was balanced. The chaos in Starlight Hollow stopped completely. The lights steadied perfectly. The trees found their right size. Everything was... perfect. Truly balanced, truly restored.

*It's perfect,* you thought, joy flooding through you. *The magic is truly balanced. The world is restored. Everything is working perfectly.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed brightly. "The magic has found true balance," it said, its voice filled with joy. "Not just stable, but truly balanced. The world is restored, relationships are healed, everything is working perfectly. This is true success."

*Everything is perfect,* you realized. *Truly balanced, truly restored. This is what we worked for.*

The story continues, leading to the ultimate resolution.
