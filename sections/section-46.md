# Searching for Connections

*Everyone has secrets,* you thought. *The question is, which secrets are about murder?*

You sat down with your notebook, trying to find connections between the suspects. Yuzu curled up at your feet, watching you work.

*Let's think about this,* you told yourself. *Marcus works here. He has access to the rare books. Alistair Finch is a rare book dealer who's been trying to buy the collection. Could they be working together?*

You thought about the business card you'd found—Alistair Finch's card, with a phone number written on the back in handwriting that wasn't Eleanor's. *Whose handwriting was it?* you wondered. *Could it be Marcus's?*

*And Beatrice,* you thought. *She's a regular customer. She's been friends with Eleanor for twenty years. But what if she knew something? What if she'd seen something, or heard something, that made her a threat?*

You looked at the evidence you'd gathered. The torn note. The letter opener. The silver button Yuzu had found. Eleanor's journal. Alistair's letter. The business card.

*There has to be a connection,* you thought. *There has to be something that ties it all together.*

You thought about the torn note: "...before Christmas Eve or else..." That sounded like a threat. But who had written it? And why?

You thought about the letter opener. It was Eleanor's, part of a set. Why would someone use her own letter opener to kill her? Unless they didn't plan it. Unless it was a crime of passion.

*But the torn note suggests planning,* you thought. *So which is it? Planned or unplanned?*

You needed to find the connections. You needed to figure out how all these pieces fit together.

What do you do?
