# Into the Book

You reached for the breathing book, your fingers hovering just above its moss-covered cover. The twinkling lights embedded in its surface seemed to pulse faster as you got closer, and you could have sworn you heard it whisper your name.

*This is probably a terrible idea,* you thought. *But when has that ever stopped me?*

The moment your fingers touched the book, the world around you dissolved. The Christmas tree, the twinkling lights, the cozy bookshop café—all of it vanished in a swirl of color and light that felt like being caught in a snow globe during an earthquake. You tumbled through what felt like pages of a story, catching glimpses of magical landscapes, snow-covered villages, and starlit skies before everything settled into something solid beneath your feet.

When the spinning stopped, you found yourself standing in a world that shouldn't have existed. The sky above was a deep twilight purple, dotted with stars that seemed to sing softly, and the ground beneath your feet was covered in snow that sparkled like crushed diamonds. In the distance, you could see a village with cozy cottages, their windows glowing with warm, golden light, but something felt... off.

The lights in the windows flickered, as if they were struggling to stay lit. The snow didn't feel quite as magical as it looked—it was cold, yes, but it lacked that sparkle of wonder you'd expected. Even the stars above seemed dimmer than they should have been, their songs quieter, more hesitant.

*Something's wrong here,* you realized. *The magic is fading.*

A voice spoke from behind you, gentle but urgent: "You've arrived just in time. The magic of this world is being stolen, and if we don't restore it before Christmas Eve, Christmas itself will fade away forever. We need your help."

You turned to see who had spoken, but the voice seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. The quest had begun, whether you were ready for it or not.

What do you do?
