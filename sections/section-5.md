# A Magical Discovery

As you round the corner, you can't believe your eyes! There, in the backyard, stands a magnificent sleigh with eight reindeer. And sitting in the driver's seat is none other than Santa Claus himself!

"Ho ho ho!" he laughs. "I've been waiting for you! Would you like to join me on my Christmas Eve journey?"

**The End**

*Thank you for playing!*
