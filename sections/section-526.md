# Another Approach

You decided to try yet another approach, thinking that maybe you needed to look at this from an even different angle. You tried something new, something different, something you hadn't tried before.

*Maybe this will work,* you thought. *Maybe this is the right approach.*

The Memory Keeper's light pulsed, and you felt something shift. The approach felt different, felt new, felt like it might reveal something.

*This feels different,* you thought. *Maybe this is the right way.*

What do you do?
