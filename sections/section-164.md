# A New Threat

As you investigated the places where magic was gathering, you discovered something alarming. In one of the towns, the magic was building up, accumulating, growing stronger and stronger. It wasn't just too much—it was dangerous. The magic was so concentrated that it was starting to destabilize, to become volatile.

*This is bad,* you thought, watching as the magic pulsed and flickered, as it began to crackle with energy. *If this keeps building, it's going to explode. It could destroy everything.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed urgently in your hands. "The magic is building up," it said, its voice worried. "It's not flowing, not sharing. It's accumulating, and if it keeps building, it will become unstable. It could cause a backlash, could destroy the town, could damage the magic itself."

Lumina's ears perked up, and they looked at the gathering magic with concern. "We need to do something," they said. "But we can't just force it. The magic needs to learn to flow, to share, to balance itself. If we force it, it might rebel, might become even more unstable."

*So we have a problem,* you realized. *The magic is building up dangerously, but we can't just force it to flow. We need to guide it, to help it understand that it needs to share, that it can't hoard all the magic for itself.*

You looked at the empty places, at the places that needed magic, and you had an idea. *What if we could show the magic that those places need it too? What if we could help it understand that sharing is better than hoarding?*

But you also knew that this was delicate. One wrong move, one moment of trying to force things, and the magic could explode, could cause even more damage.

What do you do?
