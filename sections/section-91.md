# False Ending: Accusing Alistair

You were certain. Alistair Finch had killed Eleanor. He'd been threatening her, sending her letters, trying to force her to sell her rare book collection. When she refused, he'd killed her.

You went to Officer Martinez with your theory. "Alistair Finch killed Eleanor," you said. "He's been harassing her for weeks. The torn note matches his threatening letters. He did it."

Officer Martinez listened, but her expression was skeptical. "Alistair Finch has an alibi," she said. "He was at an auction in the city, with dozens of witnesses. He couldn't have been here when Eleanor was killed."

*But alibis can be faked,* you thought. *Or he could have hired someone. Or the witnesses could be wrong.*

You insisted, and the police investigated. They checked Alistair's alibi, and it was solid. He'd been at the auction the entire time, with multiple witnesses who could confirm his presence. There was no way he could have killed Eleanor.

*But the threatening letters,* you thought. *The torn note. It all points to him.*

But then you learned something that changed everything. The torn note—the one that said "before Christmas Eve or else..."—the handwriting didn't match Alistair's. It matched someone else's. Someone who'd been trying to frame Alistair.

*I was wrong,* you realized. *I accused the wrong person. I let the red herring lead me astray.*

You looked at Yuzu, who was watching you with those bright, intelligent eyes. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows I made a mistake.*

*I need to rethink this,* you thought. *I need to go back and look at the evidence again. I need to find the real killer.*

What do you do?
