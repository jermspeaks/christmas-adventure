# Kvothe's Breaking Point

You decided to push Kvothe to take on more than they were ready for, to give them too much responsibility too quickly. You thought they could handle it, that they were strong enough. You pushed them, trying to make them do more, be more.

*They can handle it,* you thought. *They're strong.*

But pushing Kvothe too hard only made things worse. They reached their breaking point, unable to handle the pressure, unable to cope. They broke down completely, losing themselves, losing the magic, losing everything.

*I pushed too hard,* you realized, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its sadness. "You pushed Kvothe too hard," it said, its voice sad. "You gave them too much responsibility too quickly, but everyone has limits. Growth takes time, requires patience, understanding. You pushed too hard, and Kvothe reached their breaking point, losing themselves, losing the magic, losing everything."

*I pushed too hard,* you realized. *I broke them, and I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but Kvothe remains broken—unable to recover, unable to grow, a reminder that everyone has limits, that patience is more important than pushing, that understanding is the only way to truly help someone grow.
