# First Steps

"Right," you said, feeling a bit more determined than you had a moment ago. "Let's do this. Where do we start?"

Lumina's eyes brightened, and they gave you what could only be described as an approving nod. "Excellent! I was hoping you'd say that. The first step is to investigate where the magic is being taken from. We know it's happening, but we need to find the source."

They trotted ahead, leading you along a path that wound through the snow-covered landscape toward the village. The path itself was magical—literally. It glowed faintly beneath your feet, a soft golden light that made the snow sparkle just a little bit more where you stepped.

*Okay, that's pretty cool,* you thought, watching your footprints light up behind you.

"The village is called Starlight Hollow," Lumina explained as you walked. "It's one of the places where Christmas magic is strongest—or at least, it used to be. The villagers have been noticing the changes for weeks now. Lights that won't stay lit, decorations that lose their sparkle, even the hot cocoa doesn't taste quite as magical as it used to."

As you got closer, you could see the village more clearly. Cozy cottages with thatched roofs, each one decorated with garlands and wreaths that should have been glowing but instead looked... tired. The windows flickered with warm light, but it was inconsistent, like candles struggling against a breeze.

In the center of the village stood a magnificent Christmas tree, taller than any of the cottages, but even from this distance, you could see that its ornaments were dim, their usual sparkle muted. A few villagers moved about, their movements slow, their expressions worried.

"There's something else," Lumina said, pausing at the edge of the village. "We've heard whispers about a place called the Memory Vault—a hidden location where all the stolen magic might be stored. But no one knows exactly where it is, or how to get there. That's where you come in. You might be able to find it in ways we can't."

They looked at you expectantly. "So, where would you like to start?"

What do you do?
