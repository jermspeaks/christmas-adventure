# Final Push

You began the final push toward true resolution. All the combined approaches, all the merged solutions, all the strengthened connections—they all came together in one final effort to achieve true resolution, true completion, true success.

*This is the final push,* you thought, feeling the combined strength of all the approaches. *Everything is coming together, pushing toward true resolution.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed brightly. "This is the final push," it said, its voice filled with determination. "All the combined approaches, all the merged solutions, all the strengthened connections—they're all coming together, pushing toward true resolution."

*This is the final push,* you realized. *Toward true resolution. This is how it should be.*

What do you do?
