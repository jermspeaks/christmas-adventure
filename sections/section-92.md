# The Red Herring

You stuck to your theory. Alistair Finch had killed Eleanor. You were certain of it.

But as the days passed, and the police investigation continued, it became clear that you were wrong. Alistair had nothing to do with Eleanor's murder. He had a solid alibi, and the evidence that seemed to point to him was actually a red herring—someone else had written the threatening note to make it look like Alistair was the killer.

The real killer was never found. The case went cold. Eleanor's murder remained unsolved.

You visited Tombs and Trinkets sometimes, and you'd think about what had happened. You'd been so focused on Alistair, so certain that he was the killer, that you'd stopped looking for other possibilities. You'd let the red herring lead you astray.

*I was wrong,* you thought. *I let my assumptions cloud my judgment. I saw what I wanted to see, and I ignored the evidence that didn't fit.*

Yuzu was still there, still greeting customers with his usual enthusiasm. But when he saw you, he'd look at you with those bright, intelligent eyes, and you'd feel a pang of guilt. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows I made a mistake.*

The truth was never found. Justice was never served. And it was your fault, because you'd been so focused on the wrong suspect that you'd missed the real killer.

*I should have been more careful,* you thought. *I should have questioned my assumptions. I should have looked at all the evidence, not just the evidence that supported my theory.*

But it was too late now. The damage was done. The case was cold. And Eleanor's killer was still out there, free.

The story ends here, but the mystery remains unsolved.
