# Documenting the Scene

You pulled out your phone, your hands still shaking slightly, and started taking photos. *I need to document everything,* you thought. *Before the police arrive, before things get moved, before the scene changes.*

You photographed the torn note fragment, the letter opener, Eleanor's desk, the calendar open to December 22nd, the half-finished cup of tea. You photographed the office from every angle, trying to capture the exact state of things.

Yuzu watched you, his head tilted, as if he understood what you were doing. *He's a good dog,* you thought. *The best detective I've ever met.*

As you worked, you noticed things. Small details that might be important. The way the papers on Eleanor's desk were arranged—neat, organized, except for one stack that looked like it had been knocked over. The position of the letter opener—not where it should have been if it had fallen from the desk, but closer to the door, as if someone had dropped it while leaving.

*Someone was here,* you thought. *Someone killed Eleanor, and then they left. But they left evidence behind.*

You took more photos, documenting everything. The locked drawer in Eleanor's desk. The filing cabinet. The books on the shelves. The Christmas decorations that still hung on the walls, cheerful and bright, a stark contrast to what had happened here.

*This is real,* you thought. *This is actually happening. And I'm documenting it. I'm part of this now.*

In the distance, you heard sirens. The police were coming. But you had time. You had photos. You had evidence. You had Yuzu, who had found the first clue.

What do you do?
