# Kvothe's Despair

You decided to tell Kvothe they needed to move on, to stop dwelling on the past, to just get over it. You didn't understand their struggle, didn't give them time to process. You just told them to move on, to stop thinking about it.

*They need to just move on,* you thought. *They need to stop dwelling on the past.*

But telling Kvothe to just move on only made things worse. They felt dismissed, unheard, abandoned. They lost hope, lost the will to try, lost the magic that was beginning to flow through them.

*Maybe I should have been more understanding,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its sadness. "You dismissed Kvothe's struggle," it said, its voice sad. "You told them to just move on, but transformation takes time. It requires understanding, patience, support. You dismissed them, and they lost hope, lost the magic, lost everything."

*I dismissed them,* you realized. *I told them to just move on, and I lost them. I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but the magic fades—slowly, permanently, a reminder that understanding is more important than dismissal, that patience is more important than pushing, that support is the only way to truly help someone transform.
