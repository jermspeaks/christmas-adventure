# Complete Message

You continued decoding, and the message became complete. You understood the full pattern, the complete code, the entire message.

*I understand it all now,* you thought. *The complete message, the full pattern, everything.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light brightened, and you heard its voice, joyful. "You've decoded it!" it said. "The complete message! You understand everything I've been trying to tell you!"

*I do understand,* you realized. *The complete message, everything.*

You had the complete message, the full understanding, everything you needed to know.

*Now I can use this,* you thought. *Now I can help better.*

What do you do?
