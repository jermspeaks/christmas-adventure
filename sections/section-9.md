# A New Discovery

As you explored the village, something caught your eye—a small, silver ornament that had fallen from the Christmas tree and lay half-buried in the snow. It was shaped like a star, and unlike the other decorations you'd seen, this one still had a faint, warm glow.

*That's odd,* you thought, bending down to pick it up. *Everything else is dim, but this one is still shining.*

The moment your fingers touched the ornament, a wave of warmth spread through you, and you heard a voice—soft, musical, like distant bells. "You found me," the voice said. "I've been waiting for someone who could still see the magic."

You looked around, but no one was nearby except Lumina, who was investigating a flickering window. The voice seemed to be coming from the ornament itself.

"I'm a Keepsake Keeper," the ornament explained. "I hold one of the last pieces of untainted Christmas magic. The others like me have been taken, their magic drained and stored away. But I managed to hide, to preserve what little I could."

The star ornament's glow brightened slightly in your hands. "I can show you where the magic is being kept. There's a place, deep in the Frostwood Forest, where someone has been collecting all the stolen magic. They've built a vault—the Memory Vault Lumina mentioned—and they're keeping it locked away, preventing it from flowing back into the world."

You felt a tingle of excitement mixed with apprehension. *This is it. This is the clue we needed.*

"The path to the vault is hidden," the Keepsake Keeper continued. "It only appears to those who carry genuine Christmas spirit—joy, wonder, the desire to give rather than take. That's why you can find it when others can't. But be careful. The one who built the vault doesn't want the magic restored. They'll try to stop you."

The ornament's light flickered, and you noticed it was getting dimmer. "I don't have much power left. But I can guide you, if you're willing to help restore the magic. Will you help us?"

What do you do?
