# Old Ways Rejected

You decided to try to force the magic to work the old way, to make it respond to control, to power, to direction. You thought the old way was better, that you could make it work. You tried to force it.

*The old way was better,* you thought. *I can make it work.*

But the new magic rejected the old ways completely. It refused to respond to control, to power, to direction. It cut you off, locking you out permanently.

*It won't respond,* you thought. *The old ways don't work anymore.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You tried to force the old ways," it said, its voice sad. "But the magic has changed. It requires connection, memory, emotion. It cannot be controlled. You tried to force it, and it rejected you, locking you out permanently."

*I tried to force the old ways,* you realized. *I lost the magic forever.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains inaccessible—locked away from you, a reminder that change is inevitable, that adaptation is more important than forcing old ways.
