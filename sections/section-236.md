# Forced Understanding

You decided to force everyone to understand immediately, to make them learn, to not give them time. You thought they should understand right away, that you could force it. You forced the understanding.

*They should understand now,* you thought. *I can make them.*

But forcing understanding only made people resist, rebel, reject you. The magic became divisive, splitting people apart. Everything fell apart.

*They're resisting,* you thought. *The magic is splitting us apart.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You forced understanding," it said, its voice sad. "But understanding takes time, patience, connection. You forced it, and people resisted, the magic became divisive. Everything fell apart."

*I forced it,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the community remains divided—split apart, a reminder that forcing is not the answer, that patience is more important than speed.
