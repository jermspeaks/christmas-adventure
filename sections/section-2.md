# Following the Lights

You decide to follow the twinkling lights. They lead you down a winding path through a snow-covered garden. The lights seem to be guiding you somewhere special, and you can't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement.

The path continues ahead, but you still hear that mysterious sound behind you.
