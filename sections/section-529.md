# Decoding the Pattern

You continued investigating the pattern, and you began to decode it. The rhythm, the code, the message—it was slowly becoming clear.

*I'm understanding it,* you thought. *The pattern is revealing its secrets.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light brightened, and you heard its voice, excited. "You're decoding it!" it said. "The pattern. The message. You're understanding what I've been trying to tell you!"

*So there is a message,* you realized. *And I'm understanding it.*

You continued decoding, and the message became clearer. It was guidance, information, wisdom that you needed to know.

*This is important,* you thought. *This message will help me.*

What do you do?
