# Verification

You continued decoding to ensure the message was complete, to verify you understood everything, to make absolutely sure.

*I need to be sure,* you thought. *I need to verify everything is complete.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light pulsed, and you heard its voice, patient. "You've decoded most of it," it said. "Maybe all of it. But if you need to verify, that's okay. Take your time."

*I do need to verify,* you thought. *I need to be absolutely sure.*

What do you do?
