# The Trail of Fading Magic

You decided to follow the Memory Keeper's guidance and track the trail of fading magic. It wasn't hard to find—the further you got from Starlight Hollow, the more obvious it became. The snow stopped sparkling entirely. The trees looked gray and lifeless. Even the air felt thin, like someone had removed all the wonder from it.

*This is what a world without magic looks like,* you realized. *It's... sad.*

The Memory Keeper's light flickered in your hands, pulsing in a pattern that seemed to guide you forward. "This way," it whispered. "The magic has been pulled in this direction. Follow the emptiness, and you'll find where it's being stored."

Lumina trotted alongside you, their usual cheerful demeanor replaced with something more serious. "I don't like this," they said quietly. "The forest used to be beautiful. Full of life, full of magic. Now it's just... empty."

As you entered the Frostwood Forest, the change was immediate. The trees here were ancient, their branches heavy with snow that didn't sparkle at all. The path beneath your feet was dark, the magical glow you'd seen earlier completely gone. And the silence—the silence was the worst part. No birds singing, no wind rustling through the branches, no magical sounds of any kind. Just... quiet.

*Too quiet,* you thought. *Forests shouldn't be this quiet.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed slightly, and you felt a pang of concern. "Are you okay?" you asked.

"I'm fine," it said, though its voice sounded weaker. "But the closer we get to the vault, the harder it is to maintain my power. The magic here has been drained so completely that there's almost nothing left for me to draw from."

You walked deeper into the forest, following the trail of emptiness. The trees grew closer together, their branches forming a canopy overhead that blocked out most of the starlight. The path became harder to see, and you found yourself relying more and more on the Memory Keeper's faint glow to guide you.

*This is definitely not what I expected,* you thought. *I was hoping for something more... festive. Maybe some twinkling lights? A friendly snowman?*

Instead, you got a dark, silent forest that felt like it was actively trying to make you turn back.

What do you do?
