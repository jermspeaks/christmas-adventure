# Making Things Worse

You decided to keep trying, to fix the problems as they appeared. *I can do this,* you thought. *I just need to try harder, to focus more, to use the Keepsake Keeper's power more effectively.*

But every attempt made things worse. The floating toy rose higher. The flickering lights changed colors faster. The growing tree expanded more rapidly, while another tree nearby shrunk to the size of a sapling. A wreath began spinning so fast it looked like a blur. A garland froze completely, its sparkle turning to ice.

*This isn't working,* you thought, but you pushed forward anyway. *I have to keep trying. I can't give up.*

You focused all your energy on trying to stabilize everything at once, using the Keepsake Keeper to channel power, trying to force the magic to behave. But the magic resisted. It didn't want to be forced, didn't want to be controlled. It pushed back, and the chaos grew worse.

*No,* you thought. *I can't stop. I have to fix this.*

But the more you tried, the worse it got. The magic became more unstable, more chaotic, more dangerous. The townspeople began to back away, their expressions shifting from hope to fear.

"This isn't working," Elara said, her voice worried. "You're making it worse. Please, stop. We need to understand what's happening first."

Cheshire trotted forward, their expression urgent. "You're trying to force it," they said. "But magic can't be forced. It needs to be understood, guided. You're treating symptoms, not the disease. You need to stop and think."

*But I can't stop,* you thought. *I have to fix this. I have to make it work.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light began to flicker, and you could feel its concern. "You're pushing too hard," it said. "The magic is resisting because you're trying to control it, not understand it. You need to stop. You need to understand the root cause before you can fix anything."

*But what if I can't?* you wondered. *What if I'm not strong enough? What if I'm not good enough?*

What do you do?
