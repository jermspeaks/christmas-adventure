# Vigilant Celebration

You joined the celebration, but you kept your eyes open, watching, staying alert. *Something might go wrong,* you thought. *I should be ready.*

And as you watched, you began to notice small problems. A group of people trying to use the magic the old way, getting frustrated when it didn't work. A place where the magic was unbalanced, flickering uncertainly. A connection that seemed fragile, needing support.

*I was right to stay alert,* you realized. *There are problems, small ones, but they're there. And if we don't address them, they could grow.*

You saw Elara trying to use the magic, her expression confused as nothing happened. "I don't understand," she said to a neighbor. "The magic is there, but it's not responding. What am I doing wrong?"

*They need help,* you thought. *They're trying to use the old magic, but it doesn't work that way anymore. They need to understand the new way.*

Cheshire trotted over to you, their eyes bright. "You're watching," they said. "You're staying alert. That's good. There are problems, small ones, but they're there. And if we address them now, before they grow, we can help things stay balanced."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "Celebration is important," it said. "But so is awareness. If you notice problems early, you can address them before they become bigger. You can help people understand, guide them, support them, before confusion turns to frustration."

*So I can enjoy the celebration,* you thought, *but I can also stay aware, help when needed, address problems before they grow. I can do both—celebrate and help.*

You looked around, at the celebration, at the joy, at the connection. But you also saw the small problems, the places that needed help, the people who needed guidance. *I can help with those,* you realized. *I can address them now, while they're small, before they become bigger.*

What do you do?
