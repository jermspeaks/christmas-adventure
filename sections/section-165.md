# Guiding the Flow

You approached the town with the dangerous magic buildup, and you could feel the magic's intensity, its volatility. It was like standing too close to a fire—warm, but dangerous, like it could burn you if you got too close.

*We need to be careful,* you thought. *We can't force this. We need to guide it, to help it understand.*

You held up the Memory Keeper, and its light spread across the town, warm and steady. The magic seemed to respond, pulsing in time with the Memory Keeper's light, but it was still too concentrated, still too volatile.

"The magic needs to flow," you said, speaking to the magic itself, to the energy that was building up. "It needs to share, to spread, to reach the places that need it. It can't hoard all of this for itself. It needs to balance."

The magic pulsed, and you could feel its uncertainty, its resistance. It wanted to stay, wanted to gather, wanted to be strong. But it also knew, on some level, that it was too much, that it was becoming dangerous.

*It's fighting itself,* you realized. *It wants to stay, but it knows it needs to go. It wants to be strong, but it knows it needs to share.*

Lumina trotted forward, their presence calming. "The magic is scared," they said. "It's been locked away for so long, and now it's free, and it's trying to hold on, to make sure it doesn't get locked away again. But holding on too tightly is what's making it dangerous."

The Memory Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "The magic needs to understand that sharing doesn't mean losing," it said. "That flowing doesn't mean fading. That balance doesn't mean weakness. It needs to learn that the strongest magic is the magic that's shared, that's connected, that's balanced."

*So we need to show it,* you thought. *We need to help it understand that sharing is better than hoarding, that balance is better than excess.*

What do you do?
