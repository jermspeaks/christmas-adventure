# The Last Keepsake Keeper

You asked Elara about the Memory Vault, and their expression grew more serious. "The Memory Vault," they repeated, setting down their mug. "We've heard whispers about it, but no one's ever seen it. The theory is that someone—or something—has been collecting all the stolen magic and storing it there, keeping it locked away so it can't flow back into the world."

They stood and walked to a bookshelf, pulling down a leather-bound volume with a title that read *A History of Christmas Magic* in elegant script. "According to this," they said, flipping through pages, "the Memory Vault was created centuries ago as a place to store excess magic during times of great need. But it was supposed to be temporary. The magic was meant to be released back into the world when it was needed most."

*So someone's been using it wrong,* you thought. *That tracks.*

"The problem is," Elara continued, "the vault was designed to be hidden. It only reveals itself to those who carry genuine Christmas spirit—joy, wonder, the desire to give rather than take. That's why you might be able to find it when others can't."

The Keepsake Keeper ornament in your hands pulsed brighter at these words. "I can help," it said, its voice stronger now. "I'm one of the last remaining Keepsake Keepers. The others have been taken, their magic drained. But I managed to hide, to preserve what little I could. And I remember... I remember where the vault is."

You looked down at the ornament, its light warm against your palm. "You do?"

"I do," it said. "But the path is dangerous. The one who built the vault doesn't want the magic restored. They'll try to stop you. And the forest itself... the forest has changed. The magic there has been twisted, turned against itself. It won't be easy."

*Well, that's encouraging,* you thought. *Not.*

Cheshire looked at you, their expression serious. "This is it," they said. "This is what we've been waiting for. But you need to be careful. The Frostwood Forest isn't what it used to be. The magic there has been corrupted."

You held the Keepsake Keeper carefully, feeling its warmth pulse against your skin. *This is real. This is actually happening. And I'm the one who has to fix it.*

What do you do?
