# Browsing the Other Shelves

*Probably best not to investigate mysterious, glowing bookshelves that appear out of nowhere,* you told yourself. *That's how people get turned into frogs or trapped in enchanted mirrors or something.* You'd read enough fantasy novels to know that curiosity and mysterious magical objects rarely ended well.

So you turned your attention to the regular shelves instead. The fantasy section had some interesting titles—*The Complete Guide to Dragon Care*, *Spellcasting for Beginners*, *How to Train Your Familiar*—and you spent a few minutes browsing, pulling out books and reading their back covers. One book about potion-making had a recipe for "Holiday Cheer Elixir" that sounded intriguing, if not entirely practical.

You wandered over to the mystery section, then the romance section, then back to fantasy. The café was still cozy, your cocoa was still warm, and the Christmas carols were still playing softly in the background. Everything felt perfectly normal.

*See?* you thought. *Nothing magical happening here. Just a regular bookshop café on a regular December afternoon.*

But then you turned around, and there it was again—the mysterious section of bookshelves, tucked into that corner that had definitely been empty just a moment ago. The books with their shifting colors, the one that appeared to be breathing, the shelves that seemed to glow from within.

*Okay, so maybe ignoring it didn't make it go away.* You sighed. *Fine. Fine, universe, I get it.*

What do you do?
