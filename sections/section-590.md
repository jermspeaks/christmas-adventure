# Resisting the Flow

You reached out, trying to direct the magic, to control where it flowed. *If I can just guide it,* you thought, *if I can just make it go where it needs to go, then everything will be balanced.*

But the moment you tried to force it, the magic pushed back. The streams of light that had been flowing smoothly began to flicker, to pulse, to resist. The magic didn't want to be controlled—it wanted to flow naturally, to find its own way.

*It's fighting me,* you realized, watching as the magic streams became unstable, as they began to crackle with energy. *The more I try to control it, the more it resists.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed urgently in your hands. "Stop," it said, its voice worried. "The magic doesn't respond to control. It responds to guidance, to understanding, to connection. If you try to force it, it will become unstable. It could cause damage."

You pulled back, and immediately, the magic streams began to steady. But you could see the damage you'd caused—places where the magic had become chaotic, where it was flickering uncertainly, where it had lost its natural flow.

*I made it worse,* you thought. *I tried to control it, and I just made things more unstable.*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes concerned. "The magic isn't something to control," they said. "It's something to work with. It's like a river—you can't force it to go where you want, but you can guide it, help it find its natural path."

You looked at the magic streams, at the way they were flowing, at the way they were trying to find balance on their own. *They know where to go,* you realized. *They just need help understanding, not control.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light softened. "The magic needs guidance, not control," it said. "It needs someone to help it understand, to show it the way, not to force it. If you try to control it, it will resist. But if you guide it, if you help it understand, it will respond."

*So I need to learn to guide, not to control,* you thought. *I need to work with the magic, not against it.*

What do you do?
