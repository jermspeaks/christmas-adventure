# Examining the Evidence

You held the torn note fragment carefully, turning it over in your hands. The paper was expensive, cream-colored, the kind used for formal correspondence. The handwriting was sharp, angular, written in what looked like black ink. The words "...before Christmas Eve or else..." were all that remained.

*Before Christmas Eve or else what?* You looked around the office, wondering if there were more pieces of this note somewhere. Maybe in the trash? Maybe under the desk? Maybe the killer had taken the rest of it with them.

You got down on your hands and knees, Yuzu watching you curiously, and searched under the desk. Nothing. You checked the trash can—mostly empty, just a few crumpled papers that didn't match. You looked in the filing cabinet drawers, in the desk drawers, anywhere a piece of paper might have been hidden.

*Nothing.* The rest of the note was gone.

But the letter opener was still there, still on the floor where Yuzu had found it. You examined it more carefully now. It was ornate, with an ivory handle carved into the shape of a book. The blade was dark with what you knew was blood. But something about it seemed off.

You looked at Eleanor's desk. There was a set of matching stationery items—a pen holder, a paper knife, and an empty space where another letter opener should have been. *This is part of a set,* you realized. *A gift set, probably. Someone gave this to Eleanor.*

You looked for any inscription, any marking that might tell you where it came from. On the bottom of the handle, you found it—tiny, engraved letters: *To Eleanor, with love. Christmas 2015.*

*2015.* That was years ago. Who had given it to her? And why would someone use Eleanor's own letter opener to kill her?

*Unless they didn't plan it,* you thought. *Unless it was a crime of passion, something that happened in the moment. They grabbed the nearest weapon, and...*

But that didn't explain the torn note. That suggested planning, premeditation.

What do you do?
