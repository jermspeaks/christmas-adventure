# Surface Mastery

You seemed to have mastered the transformed magic. You could use it, control it, make it work. Everything seemed... perfect. Mastered. Complete.

*I've mastered it,* you thought, pride flooding through you. *I can use the magic. I'm in control.*

But as time passed, you began to notice something. You hadn't really mastered it—you'd only learned the surface. You weren't truly connected—you were just using it like a tool. The mastery was an illusion, a shallow understanding that was hiding the real depth.

*Something's missing,* you thought, but you weren't sure what. *The magic feels... shallow. Like I'm only touching the surface.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed softly, and you could feel its concern. "You've only learned the surface," it said, its voice worried. "You're not truly connected—you're just using it. This is not mastery. This is a shallow understanding. To truly master it, you need to go deeper, to truly connect, to truly understand."

*Oh,* you realized. *I haven't truly mastered it. I've only learned the surface. And if I don't go deeper, I'll never truly understand.*

What do you do?
