# Supporting Kvothe

You looked at Kvothe, at their determination, at their uncertainty, and you knew what you needed to do. "You don't have to do this alone," you said. "You don't have to figure everything out by yourself. We can work together. You can help the magic find balance, and I can help you find yours."

Kvothe's expression softened, and you saw relief in their eyes. "You'd do that?" they asked. "You'd work with me, even though I was the one who locked the magic away?"

*They're still carrying guilt,* you realized. *They still think they need to earn forgiveness, to prove themselves. But that's not how it works.*

"You locked the magic away because you were trying to protect people," you said. "You made a mistake, but your heart was in the right place. And now you're trying to fix it, to do better. That's what matters. Not the past, but what you do now."

Lumina trotted forward, their antlers catching the light. "We're all learning," they said. "We're all trying to figure out how to do this right. The important thing is that we're trying together, not alone."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly, and you could feel its approval. "Connection," it said. "That's what this is about. Not doing things alone, but doing them together. Not hiding from mistakes, but learning from them. Not protecting people from disappointment, but helping them find strength."

Kvothe smiled, and it was a real smile, warm and genuine. "Thank you," they said. "I don't know what I'm doing, but I know I want to help. And I know I don't want to do it alone."

*This is good,* you thought. *They're finding their way, and they're not doing it alone. They're learning that connection is what matters, that working together is what makes things work.*

What do you do?
