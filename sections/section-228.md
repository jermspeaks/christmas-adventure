# Giving Up on New Magic

You decided to give up, to try to find a way to use the old magic instead. You thought the new magic was too hard, that the old way was easier. You gave up, trying to find the old magic.

*The new magic is too hard,* you thought. *I'll find the old magic.*

But the old magic was gone, transformed, changed forever. There was no way to get it back. You were left with nothing, unable to use either the old or new magic.

*There's no old magic,* you thought. *I have nothing.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You gave up on the new magic," it said, its voice sad. "But the old magic is gone, transformed forever. There is no way to get it back. You gave up, and now you have nothing."

*I gave up,* you realized. *I have nothing.*

The story ends here, but you remain without magic—unable to use either old or new, a reminder that giving up is not the answer, that adaptation is more important than clinging to the past.
