# Unstable Magic

You helped Kvothe remember, and the magic began to flow, but it was unstable. It flowed back into the world, but it wasn't steady, wasn't balanced, wasn't stable. The magic was restored, but it was unpredictable, unreliable, unstable.

*The magic is restored,* you thought, relief mixed with concern. *But it's unstable.*

Kvothe looked at you, their expression grateful but worried. "I remember," they said. "I remember what Christmas means. But the magic... the magic is unstable. It's flowing, but it's not steady. It's not balanced."

*The magic is unstable,* you realized. *It's restored, but it's not stable.*

The Memory Keeper's light flickered. "The magic is restored," it said. "But it's unstable. Kvothe remembers, but the magic isn't steady. It's flowing, but it's not balanced. The world has magic again, but it's unpredictable."

*I should have ensured it was stable,* you thought. *I should have made sure the magic was balanced.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—restored, but unstable, a reminder that restoration is good, but stability is important, that balance matters, that steady magic is better than unstable magic.
