# Paranoia

You became overly skeptical and paranoid about everything. You questioned every word, doubted every intention, saw traps and lies everywhere. You couldn't trust anyone, couldn't believe anything.

*This is all a trick,* you thought. *They're trying to manipulate me. I can't trust them.*

But your paranoia made you unable to work with anyone. Lumina tried to help, but you pushed them away. The Keepsake Keeper tried to guide you, but you dismissed it. The villagers tried to assist, but you distrusted them all.

*I can't trust anyone,* you thought, but that meant you couldn't do anything.

The magic continued to fade, and you remained paralyzed by your own suspicion. Christmas Eve arrived, and the magic disappeared completely. Christmas faded forever, and you were left alone, unable to trust, unable to help, unable to make a difference.

*I was too paranoid,* you realized. *I couldn't trust anyone, and I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that trust is essential, that paranoia is a prison, that we cannot help if we cannot trust.
