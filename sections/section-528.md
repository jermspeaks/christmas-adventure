# Reckless Consequences

You continued rushing, thinking speed was everything, and your recklessness caught up with you. You made a critical mistake, you missed something important, you put yourself in danger you couldn't handle.

*This was a mistake,* you thought, but it was too late.

Your recklessness led to disaster. You triggered something, you broke something, you caused something to go wrong. The magic became more unstable, more dangerous, more difficult to restore.

*I should have been more careful,* you realized. *I should have slowed down, been more cautious.*

But it was too late. The damage was done. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever.

*My recklessness destroyed everything,* you thought. *I should have been more careful.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that recklessness has consequences, that speed without care is dangerous, that caution is important.
