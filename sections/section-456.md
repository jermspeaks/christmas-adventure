# The Collapse

You continued, thinking you were working together, but the false unity couldn't hold. The magic began to flow, but it was unstable, chaotic, dangerous. The connection between you and Kvothe broke, and the magic collapsed.

*It's not working,* you thought, but it was too late.

The magic became unstable, chaotic, dangerous. It flowed out of the vault, but it wasn't right. It was broken, corrupted, wrong. The world received magic, but it was chaotic magic, unstable magic, dangerous magic.

*I thought we were united,* you realized. *But we weren't. Not truly. And now the magic is broken.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—chaotic, unstable, a reminder that false unity is not the same as true unity, that going through the motions is not enough, that genuine cooperation is essential.
