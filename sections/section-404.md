# Time Wasted

You wasted too much time gathering information, asking questions, preparing. You thought you needed to know everything before acting, that preparation was more important than action.

*I need to know more,* you thought. *I can't act until I understand everything.*

But time was running out. The magic was fading faster every day, and Christmas Eve was approaching. While you gathered information, the magic continued to disappear. While you prepared, the world lost its wonder.

*I need just a bit more time,* you thought, but time was running out.

Christmas Eve arrived, and you were still gathering information, still preparing, still not acting. The magic faded completely, and Christmas disappeared forever. The world became ordinary, and you were left with all your knowledge, all your preparation, but nothing to use it for.

*I wasted too much time,* you realized. *I prepared, but I never acted.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that preparation without action is meaningless, that sometimes we must act with incomplete information, that time is precious.
