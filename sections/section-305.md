# Good Celebration

You addressed the underlying issues while celebrating, and the celebration was good. It wasn't perfect—some issues remained unresolved, some problems still existed—but it was good. The celebration was real, built on addressing problems, not ignoring them. Everything was... better. Not perfect, but better.

*It's a good celebration,* you thought, joy mixed with realism. *Not perfect, but good. Some issues remain, but that's okay. Good is enough, and we can keep working.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "The celebration is good," it said, its voice thoughtful. "Not perfect, but good. Some issues remain unresolved, but that's okay. Good is enough, and you can keep working. The celebration is real, and that's what matters."

*It's a good celebration,* you realized. *Not perfect, but good. And that's enough.*

The story ends here, but the celebration continues—real, good, a reminder that perfection isn't necessary, that good is enough, that addressing problems is more important than ignoring them.
