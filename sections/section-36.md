# Calling for Help

Your hands shook as you pulled out your phone, your fingers fumbling with the buttons. *911. I need to call 911.* The operator's voice was calm and professional, asking questions you answered automatically while your mind raced. *Eleanor Hartwell. Murdered. In her own bookshop. Three days before Christmas.*

*This can't be real,* you kept thinking, but Yuzu's presence—his warm body pressed against your leg, his soft whine—kept you grounded. He hadn't left your side since you'd found Eleanor, and you were grateful for it.

The operator told you to stay where you were, that help was on the way. But you couldn't just stand there, not when there might be other people in the shop. Not when the killer might still be nearby.

You stepped out of the office, Yuzu following close behind, and made your way back toward the main shop area. The Christmas lights still twinkled, the books still sat on their shelves, but everything felt different now. Tainted. Wrong.

*Who else is here?* you thought. *Who else might have seen something?*

You heard voices coming from the café area—low, worried voices. As you approached, you saw two people sitting at a table. A young man in his twenties, pale and shaken, and an older woman in a cashmere coat, her expression carefully controlled.

The young man looked up as you approached. "Is it true?" he asked, his voice trembling. "Is Eleanor...?"

You nodded, and his face crumpled. "I'm Marcus," he said. "Marcus Chen. I work here. I was in the rare books section when... when it happened. I can't believe this."

The older woman stood up, her movements precise and controlled. "I'm Beatrice Morrison," she said. "I'm a regular customer. I've been here for over an hour, looking for a gift. I saw Eleanor earlier—she seemed fine. A bit stressed, perhaps, but that's normal this time of year."

*Both of them were here,* you thought. *Both of them could have done it. Or one of them. Or neither.*

In the distance, you heard sirens. The police were coming. But before they arrived, you had a chance to observe, to notice things, to see how these people reacted to the news.

What do you do?
