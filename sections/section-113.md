# True Ending: Complete Investigation

You had done it. You'd gathered all the evidence, verified everything, and solved the case. Marcus Chen had killed Eleanor Hartwell. He'd been stealing rare books from the collection, selling them to pay off his debts. When Eleanor found out and confronted him, he'd panicked and killed her with her own letter opener.

The evidence was overwhelming. The silver button from his cardigan, found near Eleanor's desk. The inconsistencies in his alibi. The letter from Alistair Finch that proved Marcus had been stealing. The torn note that matched Marcus's handwriting. Eleanor's journal entries that showed she was going to confront him.

Marcus was arrested and charged with murder. The case was closed. Justice would be served.

A week later, you found yourself back at Tombs and Trinkets. The police had finished their investigation, and the bookshop had been closed for a few days while everything was sorted out. But now it was open again, and you'd been asked to come in.

The shop felt different without Eleanor—quieter, somehow, as if it was missing its heart. But the Christmas lights still twinkled, and the smell of old books and cinnamon still filled the air, and you found yourself taking comfort in that.

Yuzu was there, of course, trotting up to greet you with his usual enthusiasm, his red bow collar still perfectly tied. He'd been staying with one of Eleanor's neighbors, but it seemed like he'd claimed the bookshop as his own.

"You're back," said a voice, and you turned to see Beatrice Morrison, sitting at one of the café tables with a cup of tea. "I thought you might be. Yuzu's been waiting for you."

"You've been coming here?" you asked.

"Every day," Beatrice said. "Someone has to look after the place. And Yuzu, of course. Eleanor would have wanted that."

You sat down across from her, and Yuzu immediately jumped into your lap, settling down with a contented sigh. "What's going to happen to the shop?" you asked.

"Eleanor's will left it to Marcus," Beatrice said, her voice tight. "But given the circumstances, that's being contested. Her lawyer thinks the shop should go to her niece, who lives out of state. But in the meantime..." She gestured around. "I'm keeping it running. With help, of course."

You looked around the shop, at the books and the lights and the cozy atmosphere. *It's still here,* you thought. *Despite everything, it's still here.*

"You know," Beatrice said, "Eleanor would have appreciated what you did. Finding the truth. She always said that books taught us that the truth matters, even when it's hard. Even when it hurts."

You thought about that. About Eleanor, and Marcus, and the rare books, and the letter opener, and the button Yuzu had found. About how a cozy mystery had turned into something real, something tragic, but also something that had been solved.

*We found the truth,* you thought. *That has to count for something.*

Yuzu looked up at you, his bright eyes full of what could only be described as pure doggy wisdom, and you found yourself smiling despite everything.

"You're a good dog, Yuzu," you said, scratching behind his ears. "The best detective I've ever met."

Yuzu's tail thumped against your leg, and you knew, somehow, that this wasn't the end of your story with Tombs and Trinkets. Maybe you'd come back. Maybe you'd help Beatrice keep the shop running. Maybe you'd just visit, sometimes, to see Yuzu and remember Eleanor and the mystery you'd solved together.

But for now, you sat in the cozy bookshop, with a dog in your lap and Christmas lights twinkling overhead, and you let yourself feel, for just a moment, like everything might be okay.

The truth had been found. Justice would be served. And Tombs and Trinkets would go on, because places like this, places full of books and warmth and magic, they always did.
