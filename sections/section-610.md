# Struggling with Change

You reached out, trying to use the magic the way you always had—with control, with direction, with power. *This is how it works,* you thought. *I know how to do this.*

But nothing happened. The magic didn't respond. It just... sat there, waiting. Like it was asking for something you weren't giving it.

*What's wrong?* you thought, trying again, pushing harder, trying to force it to work. *Why isn't it responding?*

The magic remained still, unresponsive. You could feel it there, warm and present, but it wasn't doing what you wanted. It wasn't following your commands, your directions, your control.

*This doesn't make sense,* you realized, frustration building. *The magic should work. I know how to use it. Why isn't it working?*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes gentle. "The magic has changed," they said. "It doesn't work the old way anymore. It's not about control or power now—it's about connection, about memory, about emotion. You can't force it to work the old way because the old way doesn't exist anymore."

You looked at your hands, at the magic that wasn't responding, and you felt a pang of something—loss, maybe, or confusion. *I don't know how to use this,* you thought. *I don't understand how it works now.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed softly in your hands. "Change is hard," it said. "It's natural to want to hold onto what you know, what you understand. But the magic has transformed, and it needs you to transform with it. It needs you to learn a new way, to understand that it's not about control anymore—it's about connection."

*So I have to learn all over again,* you thought. *I have to let go of what I know and learn something new.*

You looked at the magic, at the way it was waiting, patient and warm. *It's not broken,* you realized. *It's just different. And I need to learn how to work with it, not against it.*

What do you do?
