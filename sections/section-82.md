# Pushing Too Hard

"You need to tell the truth," you said, leaning forward. "I know what happened. I have the evidence. The button, the note, the letter. It all points to you. Just confess, Marcus. It'll be easier if you confess."

Marcus looked at you, his eyes wide with fear. "I... I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't do anything."

*But he's lying,* you thought. *I can see it in his eyes. He's scared. He knows I'm right.*

You pushed harder. "The police are going to find out anyway. They're going to verify the handwriting. They're going to check your financial records. They're going to prove it was you. So just tell me the truth now. What happened?"

Marcus's hands were shaking. "I... I didn't mean to. It was an accident. We argued, and I... I panicked. I grabbed the letter opener, and... I didn't mean to kill her. I swear, I didn't mean to."

*There it is,* you thought. *He confessed. I was right.*

But as you pressed him for more details, as you tried to get him to tell you everything, you realized you'd made mistakes. You'd been so focused on getting a confession that you hadn't been careful about how you'd done it. You'd accused him in front of others. You'd made assumptions about evidence you hadn't verified. You'd jumped to conclusions about Velma and Alistair earlier, creating suspicion where there shouldn't have been any.

Officer Martinez appeared, and you explained what had happened. Marcus had confessed, you said. You'd solved the case.

But Officer Martinez's expression was serious. "We'll need to verify everything," she said. "And we'll need to make sure the confession was obtained properly. You can't just accuse someone and pressure them into confessing."

*But I was right,* you thought. *He did confess. He did kill Eleanor.*

And later, when the police had done their own investigation, when they'd verified all the evidence, Marcus was arrested and charged. You'd been right about him, in the end.

But you'd also been wrong about how you'd handled it. You'd rushed. You'd pressured. You'd accused people without enough evidence. You'd created problems that wouldn't have existed if you'd been more careful, more thorough, more certain before you started making accusations.

The truth had been found, but not without complications.
