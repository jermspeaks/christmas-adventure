# Kael's Breaking Point

You accepted that Kael was fine, thinking everything was resolved. You celebrated, thinking the problem was solved. But the Memory Keeper was right—Kael was only suppressing, not truly adjusting.

Weeks passed, and the suppression began to weaken. Kael started to crack, the mask slipping, the truth showing through. And then, one day, they broke.

Kael's suppression collapsed completely, and they reverted to the guardian of shadows, locking the magic away permanently. This time, they locked it away with anger, with bitterness, with the knowledge that they had been suppressing, not truly transforming.

*I should have noticed,* you thought, watching Kael revert. *I should have helped them truly transform. I should have found the real solution.*

But it was too late. Kael was lost, and the magic was locked away forever.

The story ends here, but Kael remains lost—reverted, bitter, a reminder that suppression is not the same as transformation, that temporary fixes are not solutions, that helping someone truly transform is more important than accepting false solutions.
