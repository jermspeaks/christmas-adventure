# The Whispering Trees

As you walked deeper into the Frostwood Forest, you began to notice something strange. The silence wasn't quite as complete as you'd thought. There were whispers—faint, barely audible, but definitely there. They seemed to come from the trees themselves, their voices like the rustling of leaves in a breeze that didn't exist.

*Okay, that's not creepy at all,* you thought. *Talking trees. Why not?*

The Memory Keeper's light flickered, and you heard its voice, soft and urgent. "The trees," it said. "They're trying to tell you something. But their voices are weak, like mine. The magic that gave them life has been drained away."

You paused, listening more carefully. The whispers were hard to make out, but you could catch fragments of words: "...too late..." "...the vault..." "...danger..." "...turn back..."

*Turn back?* you thought. *That's not helpful.*

Lumina stopped beside you, their ears twitching as they tried to hear the whispers. "They're warning us," they said quietly. "The trees remember what the forest used to be. They know what's happening, and they're trying to help."

You stepped closer to one of the trees—an ancient oak with bark that looked like it had seen centuries pass. You placed your hand against its trunk, and immediately, you felt something. A faint pulse, like a heartbeat, but so weak it was barely there.

*The tree is alive,* you realized. *But just barely. The magic that sustains it is almost gone.*

The whispers grew slightly louder, and you could make out more words: "...the path... follow the light... trust the keeper... the vault waits... but beware... the guardian..."

*The guardian?* you thought. *That doesn't sound good.*

The Memory Keeper's light brightened slightly. "They're telling us the way," it said. "Follow the light. Trust me. The vault is close, but there's something guarding it. Something that doesn't want the magic restored."

You looked at Lumina, who looked back at you with an expression that was equal parts determination and concern. "Well," you said, "at least we know we're on the right track."

*And that there's a guardian waiting for us,* you added silently. *Which is definitely not concerning at all.*

What do you do?
