# False Ending: Accusing Beatrice

You were certain. Beatrice Morrison had killed Eleanor. She'd been in the shop, she'd found Eleanor's body, she'd been acting suspiciously. The evidence all pointed to her.

You went to Officer Martinez with your theory. "Beatrice killed Eleanor," you said. "She was here, she found the body, and she's been lying about what she saw."

Officer Martinez listened, but her expression was skeptical. "What evidence do you have?" she asked.

"The book she took," you said. "She was trying to hide something. And she admitted she found Eleanor's body but didn't call for help. That's suspicious."

"But that's not evidence of murder," Officer Martinez said. "That's just suspicious behavior. We need more than that."

*But I'm sure,* you thought. *It has to be her.*

The police investigated Beatrice, but they found nothing. No motive, no opportunity, no physical evidence connecting her to the crime. She had an alibi—she'd been in the mystery section the whole time, and other customers had seen her there.

*But that doesn't mean she didn't do it,* you thought. *She could have slipped away, killed Eleanor, and come back.*

But the evidence didn't support that. The timeline didn't work. The physical evidence didn't match.

*I was wrong,* you realized. *I accused the wrong person. I let my suspicions cloud my judgment.*

You looked at Yuzu, who was watching you with those bright, intelligent eyes. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows I made a mistake.*

*I need to rethink this,* you thought. *I need to go back and look at the evidence again. I need to find the real killer.*

What do you do?
