# Pattern Recognition

You continued investigating from this different angle, and you began to see the pattern more clearly. The Keepsake Keeper's light was pulsing in a specific rhythm, a code that seemed to contain information.

*There's information here,* you realized. *If I can decode it, I might learn something important.*

The Keepsake Keeper's voice, when it spoke, sounded surprised. "You're seeing the pattern," it said. "The rhythm. The code. That's... that's not something most people notice. You're seeing deeper than most."

*So there is something hidden,* you thought. *Something in the pattern.*

You continued studying the pattern, and slowly, you began to understand it. It wasn't just random pulsing—it was a message. Information. Guidance.

*This is important,* you realized. *This pattern contains something I need to know.*

What do you do?
