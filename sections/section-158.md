# Discovering Purpose

As Kael processed their memories, one at a time, you could see them beginning to find their footing. They were still uncertain, still figuring things out, but they were no longer drowning. They were learning to swim.

"I think I understand now," Kael said, their voice thoughtful. "I was the guardian because I was trying to protect people from disappointment. But that's not what protection means. Protection isn't about hiding things away—it's about helping people find strength, find joy, even when things are hard."

*They're getting it,* you thought. *They're understanding who they are, what they want to be.*

Lumina trotted forward, their eyes bright. "You were protecting people from the wrong thing," they said. "You were protecting them from disappointment, but you ended up protecting them from joy, too. That's not protection—that's fear."

Kael nodded slowly. "I was afraid," they admitted. "Afraid of seeing people disappointed, afraid of watching the magic fail. But you showed me that failure isn't the end. That disappointment isn't the worst thing. The worst thing is not trying at all."

The Memory Keeper pulsed warmly. "You have a new purpose now," it said. "Not as a guardian who locks things away, but as someone who helps magic flow, who helps people find joy, who helps the world remember what Christmas really means."

Kael looked at you, and you saw determination in their eyes. "I want to help," they said. "I want to help the magic find balance. I want to help people understand that Christmas isn't about perfection—it's about connection, about trying, about finding joy even when things aren't perfect."

*They're finding their way,* you thought. *They're discovering who they want to be, what they want to do. But they still need support. They still need to know they're not alone.*

What do you do?
