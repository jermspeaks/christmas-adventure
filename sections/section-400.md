# Rejected Help

You dismissed Cheshire as not helpful, or ignored the Keepsake Keeper's warning, thinking you didn't need their help. You were confident you could figure this out on your own, that their guidance was unnecessary.

*I don't need help,* you thought. *I can do this myself.*

But without Cheshire's guidance or the Keepsake Keeper's wisdom, you quickly became lost. The magical world was too complex, too unfamiliar. You wandered aimlessly, unable to find the Memory Vault, unable to understand what was happening.

*This is harder than I thought,* you realized, but it was too late.

The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived with you still lost, still wandering. The magic faded completely, and Christmas disappeared forever—not just in this world, but everywhere. The warmth, the joy, the wonder—all of it gone, because you thought you didn't need help.

*I should have listened,* you thought, watching the last sparkle of magic fade from the world. *I should have accepted the help that was offered.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that accepting help is not weakness, that guidance is essential, that we cannot do everything alone.
