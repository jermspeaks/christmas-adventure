# Alone Again

You decided to tell Kvothe they needed to figure it out alone, that you couldn't help them anymore. You thought they needed independence, that your help was holding them back. You left them to struggle alone.

*They need to do it themselves,* you thought. *They don't need me.*

But leaving Kvothe alone only made things worse. They became lost, unable to find their way, unable to transform. They lost hope, lost the magic, lost everything.

*Maybe I should have stayed,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its sadness. "You abandoned Kvothe," it said, its voice sad. "You told them to figure it out alone, but transformation requires support, requires help, requires connection. You abandoned them, and they became lost, losing hope, losing the magic, losing everything."

*I abandoned them,* you realized. *I left them alone, and I lost them. I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but Kvothe remains alone—unable to transform, unable to find their way, a reminder that support is more important than independence, that help is more important than leaving someone alone, that connection is the only way to truly help someone transform.
