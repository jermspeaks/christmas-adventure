# Branching Paths

You held the Memory Keeper ornament carefully in your hands, feeling its warmth pulse gently against your palm. *This is real. This is actually happening.* The quest had taken on a new urgency now that you had a concrete destination—the Frostwood Forest, where the Memory Vault was hidden.

Lumina trotted over, their eyes widening when they saw the glowing ornament. "You found a Memory Keeper!" they exclaimed, their voice filled with wonder. "I haven't seen one of those in weeks. They've all been disappearing, one by one. This is excellent news—and also very concerning. It means we're running out of time."

The Memory Keeper's light flickered again, and you could feel its power waning. "The path to the Frostwood Forest is not easy to find," it said, its voice growing fainter. "You'll need to follow the trail of fading magic. Where the lights are dimmest, where the snow doesn't sparkle, that's where the magic has been taken from. Follow that trail, and it will lead you to the forest."

You looked toward the horizon, where you could just make out the edge of a dark, snow-covered forest. The trees there looked different from the cozy village—taller, older, their branches heavy with snow that didn't seem to sparkle at all.

"The Frostwood Forest," Lumina said, following your gaze. "It's not a place we usually go. The magic there has been fading faster than anywhere else. But if that's where the vault is..." They trailed off, their expression thoughtful.

You had a decision to make. You could head straight for the forest, following the Memory Keeper's guidance. Or you could take a moment to prepare—gather more information, talk to the villagers, see if anyone else knew something that could help. Or you could consult with Lumina, who seemed to know more about this world than they'd let on.

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed a little more. "I can't hold on much longer," it whispered. "But I'll do my best to guide you, whatever path you choose."

What do you do?
