# Gathering Final Proof

*I need to be absolutely sure,* you thought. *Before I accuse anyone, I need to have all the evidence. I need to be certain.*

You sat down with your notebook, going through everything you'd found. The torn note. The letter opener. The silver button. Eleanor's journal. Alistair's letter. The business card.

*It all points to Marcus,* you thought. *But I need to verify it. I need to make sure.*

You thought about the silver button. It matched Marcus's cardigan. But could you prove it? Could you show that it definitely came from his cardigan?

You thought about Marcus's alibi. He said he'd been working in the rare books section, but there was no evidence of that. But could you prove he wasn't there? Could you prove he was in the office instead?

You thought about the torn note. The handwriting was sharp, angular. You'd compared it to Marcus's handwriting from a catalog, and it seemed to match. But was that enough? Could you be certain?

*I need more proof,* you thought. *I need something definitive.*

You thought about Marcus's financial records. If he'd been stealing rare books and selling them, there should be evidence of that. Large deposits, unexplained income, something.

*I need to find that evidence,* you thought. *I need to prove it beyond a doubt.*

What do you do?
