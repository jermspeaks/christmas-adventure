# Forced Flow

You decided to try to force magic to go to the empty places, to make it flow where you wanted it to. You didn't let it flow naturally—you forced it, trying to control where it went.

*I can make it go where I want,* you thought. *I just need to force it.*

But forcing the magic only made things worse. It became corrupted, unstable, dangerous. The magic flow became permanently broken, unable to flow naturally, unable to find balance.

*What have I done?* you thought. *I forced it, and I broke it.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You forced the magic," it said, its voice sad. "You tried to control where it flowed, but magic must flow naturally. It cannot be forced. You forced it, and it became corrupted, unstable, dangerous. The magic flow is now permanently broken."

*I forced it,* you realized. *I broke the magic flow.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains corrupted—unable to flow naturally, a reminder that forcing is not the answer, that natural flow is more important than control.
