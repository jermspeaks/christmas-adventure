# The Christmas Adventure Begins

It was December 22nd, three days before Christmas, and you'd been hiding in The Twinkling Pages for the better part of an hour. The bookshop café was your favorite escape from holiday chaos—a place where you could pretend you weren't procrastinating on finding the perfect gifts for your family. (You were, of course, but at least you were doing it with a warm cup of peppermint cocoa in hand.)

The café smelled of old books, cinnamon, and something else you couldn't quite name—something that made your skin tingle pleasantly, like the air before a thunderstorm. Soft Christmas carols played in the background, and fairy lights twinkled along the bookshelves that stretched toward the ceiling. You'd been browsing the fantasy section, running your fingers along spines that felt warm to the touch, when you noticed something odd.

A section of bookshelves that definitely hadn't been there when you'd walked in.

You blinked. *That's new.* The shelves were tucked into a corner you were certain had been empty just moments ago, and they seemed to glow faintly, as if lit from within. The books on these shelves had spines in colors you'd never seen before—deep purples that shifted to blues, golds that shimmered like starlight, and one that appeared to be breathing.

*Okay, that's definitely not normal.* But then again, neither was the fact that your cocoa had somehow stayed perfectly warm for the past hour, or that the books on the shelf behind you seemed to have rearranged themselves when you weren't looking.

What do you do?
