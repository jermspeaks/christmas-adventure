# False Unity

You thought you were opening the vault together, that you and Kvothe were united, that you were working as one. You placed your hands on the archway together, feeling the connection, the unity, the shared purpose.

*We're doing this together,* you thought. *We're united.*

But as the magic began to flow, you realized something was wrong. The connection felt weak, the unity felt false, the shared purpose wasn't truly shared. You and Kvothe weren't truly united—you were just going through the motions, pretending to work together.

*This isn't working,* you thought. *We're not truly united.*

The Memory Keeper's light flickered, and you heard its voice, worried. "You're not truly united," it said. "You're going through the motions, but you're not really working together. The vault requires genuine unity, true cooperation, real shared purpose."

*We need to truly unite,* you realized. *We need to really work together.*

What do you do?
