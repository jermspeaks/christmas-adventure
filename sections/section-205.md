# Forced Imbalance

You decided to try to speed things up by forcing more magic into the weak areas, trying to balance everything immediately. You didn't take time to understand, to guide, to help the magic learn. You just forced it, trying to make it work faster.

*I can make this work faster,* you thought. *I just need to force more magic into the weak areas.*

But forcing magic only made things worse. The weak areas couldn't handle the sudden influx of magic, and they became overwhelmed, unstable, dangerous. The magic became permanently imbalanced, with some areas having too much and others too little, and no way to fix it.

*What have I done?* you thought. *I forced it, and I broke everything.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed, and you could feel its disappointment. "You forced it," it said, its voice sad. "You tried to speed things up by forcing magic, but magic cannot be forced. It must be guided, learned, understood. You forced it, and you broke it. The magic is now permanently imbalanced, with no way to fix it."

*I forced it,* you realized. *I tried to make it work faster, and I broke it. I created permanent imbalance.*

The story ends here, but the magic continues—imbalanced, unstable, a reminder that forcing is not the answer, that patience is more important than speed, that guidance is the only way to truly help magic find balance.
