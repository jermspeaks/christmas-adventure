# Forced Learning

You decided to force people to understand even if they resisted, to make them learn, to not accept no. You thought you knew what was best, that you could force them. You forced the learning.

*I know what's best,* you thought. *I can make them learn.*

But forcing learning only made people resist more, rebel, reject you completely. The community trust broke, and the magic lost its connection power.

*They're resisting more,* you thought. *The trust is broken.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You forced learning," it said, its voice sad. "But learning requires willingness, connection, trust. You forced it, and people resisted, the trust broke, the magic lost its connection power."

*I forced it,* you realized. *I broke everything.*

The story ends here, but the community remains broken—trust lost, magic weakened, a reminder that forcing is not the answer, that trust is more important than control.
