# Abandoned Teaching

You decided to give up when some people resisted learning, to stop trying, to walk away. You thought it was too hard, that some people didn't want to learn. You gave up.

*Some people don't want to learn,* you thought. *I'm giving up.*

But giving up only made the magic remain partially misunderstood, fading away. Some people never learned, and the magic faded partially.

*The magic is fading,* you thought. *It's going away.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You gave up," it said, its voice sad. "But teaching requires persistence, patience, not giving up. You gave up, and the magic remained partially misunderstood, fading away."

*I gave up,* you realized. *I lost part of the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains partially misunderstood—faded, weakened, a reminder that giving up is not the answer, that persistence is more important than giving up.
