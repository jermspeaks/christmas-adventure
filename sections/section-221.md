# Magic Overload

You decided to try to absorb the excess magic yourself, to take it all in, to control it. You thought you could handle it, that you were strong enough. You tried to absorb it all.

*I can handle it,* you thought. *I'm strong enough.*

But absorbing too much magic only made you overload. You became unstable, dangerous, unable to control yourself. The magic consumed you, destroying you completely.

*I can't control it,* you thought, but it was too late.

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You tried to absorb too much magic," it said, its voice sad. "But no one can handle that much magic. You overloaded, becoming unstable, dangerous. The magic consumed you, destroying you completely."

*I tried to absorb it all,* you realized. *I destroyed myself.*

The story ends here, but you remain destroyed—consumed by magic, a reminder that no one can handle unlimited power, that limits are important, that sharing is more important than hoarding.
