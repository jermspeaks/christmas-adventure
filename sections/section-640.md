# Delayed Understanding

You stepped back, watching the townspeople, waiting to see if they would figure it out on their own. *Maybe they just need time,* you thought. *Maybe they'll understand if I give them space.*

But as the hours passed, you began to notice problems. People were getting frustrated, trying to use the magic the old way, failing, and then giving up. Some were trying to force it, which only made things worse. Others had stopped trying altogether, convinced the magic was broken.

*This isn't working,* you realized, watching as confusion turned to frustration, as hope turned to disappointment. *They're not figuring it out. They need help.*

You saw Elara trying to use the magic, her hands shaking with frustration as nothing happened. "It's not working," she said to a neighbor. "I don't understand. The magic is there, I can feel it, but it won't respond. What am I doing wrong?"

*They need guidance,* you thought. *They need someone to help them understand, to show them the way. Waiting isn't helping—it's making things worse.*

Cheshire trotted over to you, their eyes worried. "The people are struggling," they said. "They're trying, but they don't understand. They need help, guidance, someone to show them the way. Waiting isn't helping—it's just letting the problems grow."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed urgently. "The magic needs to be understood," it said. "It needs someone to help people learn, to guide them, to show them how to connect, to remember, to share. If you wait too long, the confusion will grow, the frustration will build, and people will give up."

*So I need to intervene,* you thought. *I need to help them understand, to guide them, to teach them. Waiting isn't the answer—helping is.*

You looked at the townspeople, at their frustration, at their confusion, at their need for help. *They've been waiting long enough,* you realized. *It's time to help.*

What do you do?
