# Kael's Peace

You worked with Kael, helping them truly transform, and they found peace. They weren't perfect—they still struggled sometimes, still had moments of uncertainty—but they were at peace. They had found their purpose, their place, their way.

*They're at peace,* you thought, relief mixed with understanding. *Not perfect, but at peace. The magic is still slightly unstable, but that's okay. Kael is happy, and that's what matters.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed warmly. "Kael has found peace," it said, its voice thoughtful. "Not perfect peace, but real peace. The magic is still slightly unstable, but that's okay. Stability isn't everything—peace is. Kael is happy, and that's what matters."

*Kael is at peace,* you realized. *Not perfect, but real. And that's what matters.*

The story ends here, but Kael continues—at peace, transformed, a reminder that perfection isn't necessary, that peace is enough, that happiness is what matters.
