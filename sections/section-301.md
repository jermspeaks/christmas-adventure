# Kvothe's Peace

You worked with Kvothe, helping them truly transform, and they found peace. They weren't perfect—they still struggled sometimes, still had moments of uncertainty—but they were at peace. They had found their purpose, their place, their way.

*They're at peace,* you thought, relief mixed with understanding. *Not perfect, but at peace. The magic is still slightly unstable, but that's okay. Kvothe is happy, and that's what matters.*

The Memory Keeper pulsed warmly. "Kvothe has found peace," it said, its voice thoughtful. "Not perfect peace, but real peace. The magic is still slightly unstable, but that's okay. Stability isn't everything—peace is. Kvothe is happy, and that's what matters."

*Kvothe is at peace,* you realized. *Not perfect, but real. And that's what matters.*

The story ends here, but Kvothe continues—at peace, transformed, a reminder that perfection isn't necessary, that peace is enough, that happiness is what matters.
