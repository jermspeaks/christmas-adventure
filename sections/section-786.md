# Rushed Memories

You didn't stop. You couldn't stop. *They need to understand,* you thought, the words tumbling out faster. "You're not the guardian of shadows anymore—you're someone who helps people, who brings joy, who makes Christmas magic flow. You remember your family, don't you? Your childhood? The way Christmas used to feel? You need to remember all of it, right now, so the magic can flow properly."

Kvothe's eyes widened, and you saw the panic there, but you kept going. "The magic needs you to remember," you said. "It needs you to understand who you are, what your role is. You're the guardian of balanced magic now, and you need to remember everything, all at once, so we can restore the magic to the world."

"No," Kvothe said, their voice breaking. "Please, I can't—"

But it was too late. The memories came flooding back, not in a gentle stream but in a torrent. Images of their family, their childhood, their transformation—all of it crashing in at once, overwhelming, chaotic, too much to process. You saw it in their eyes, the way they were drowning in memories, the way they couldn't hold it all.

*They're remembering,* you thought, relief mixing with something else—something that felt like concern, but you pushed it away. *This is what they need. This is what the magic needs.*

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed urgently in your hands, its light flickering. "Stop," it said, its voice sharp with worry. "You're rushing too fast. The memories are coming back, but they're not being processed. They're just... flooding. This isn't right."

But you couldn't stop now. The magic was responding. You could feel it, feel it beginning to flow, feel it responding to Kvothe's memories. The streams of light that had been waiting began to move, began to flow outward, began to spread across the world.

*It's working,* you thought. *The magic is flowing. Kvothe is remembering. Everything is happening.*

But then you noticed something. The magic streams weren't flowing smoothly. They were flickering, pulsing, moving in fits and starts. Some places were getting too much magic, overwhelming everything. Others were getting too little, barely touched. The magic was flowing, but it wasn't steady. It wasn't balanced.

*Something's wrong,* you realized, watching as the magic streams became chaotic, as they flickered and pulsed unpredictably.

Kvothe looked at you, their expression grateful but worried. "I remember," they said, their voice shaking. "I remember what Christmas means. I remember my family, my childhood, all of it. But the magic... the magic is unstable. It's flowing, but it's not steady. It's not balanced."

The Keepsake Keeper's light flickered, matching the unstable magic. "The magic is restored," it said, its voice sad. "But it's unstable. Kvothe remembers, but the magic isn't steady. It's flowing, but it's not balanced. The world has magic again, but it's unpredictable."

*I should have slowed down,* you thought, watching as the magic flickered and pulsed, as it became unstable. *I should have helped them process one memory at a time, not rushed them through everything. But it's too late now.*

The magic was restored, but it was unstable, unpredictable, unreliable. And you had no one to blame but yourself.
