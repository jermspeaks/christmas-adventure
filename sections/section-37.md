# Following Yuzu's Trail

Yuzu looked back at you, his bright eyes full of something that could only be described as determination. *He knows something,* you thought. *He's found something, and he wants to show me.*

You followed him out of the office, back through the narrow hallway, past the mystery novels and the fantasy section. But instead of going back to the main shop, Yuzu turned down a different hallway—one you hadn't noticed before, leading to the back of the building.

*Where is he taking me?*

Yuzu trotted ahead, his nose to the ground, sniffing with an intensity that suggested he was following a scent. He stopped at a door—a storage room, by the looks of it—and pawed at it, whining softly.

You pushed the door open, and Yuzu immediately darted inside. The room was exactly what you'd expect from a place called Tombs and Trinkets—cramped, dusty, and filled with boxes of books, old furniture, and what looked like decades of accumulated treasures.

Yuzu went straight to a particular box, pawing at it insistently. You knelt down and pulled the box out. It was filled with old letters, tied with a faded ribbon, sitting on a shelf that looked like it hadn't been touched in years.

But Yuzu wasn't interested in the letters. He was pawing at something behind the box—a small notebook, tucked away where it shouldn't have been. You pulled it out, and your heart sank as you read the elegant handwriting on the cover: *Eleanor's Journal.*

You flipped through it, reading entries dated over the past few weeks. The entries told a story you hadn't expected.

*December 15th: Another threat. This has to stop.*
*December 18th: Marcus is acting strange. I should talk to him.*
*December 20th: The rare book collection. Someone knows. Someone's been asking questions.*
*December 22nd: Tonight. I'll confront them tonight. It has to end.*

*Tonight,* you thought. *She was going to confront someone tonight. And now she's dead.*

Yuzu pawed at something else—a business card that had been hidden under the notebook. You picked it up. It was for a rare book dealer, someone named "Alistair Finch," with an address in the city. The card was creased, as if it had been handled many times, and someone had written a phone number on the back in handwriting that wasn't Eleanor's.

*Yuzu found these,* you thought. *He led me here. He knows something important.*

What do you do?
