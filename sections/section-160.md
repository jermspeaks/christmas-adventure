# Working Together

You and Kvothe began to work together, and you could feel the difference it made. Kvothe's understanding of the magic's nature, combined with your connection to the Memory Keeper and the Christmas spirit, created something stronger than either of you could have done alone.

*This is what it should be,* you thought, watching as Kvothe helped guide the magic, as they used their understanding of balance to help the magic find its way. *Not one person trying to do everything, but people working together, each bringing their own strengths.*

Lumina trotted alongside you, their presence calming, their connection to the natural world helping the magic understand its place. The Memory Keeper pulsed warmly in your hands, channeling your intent, your connection with Kvothe, your shared purpose.

"It's working," Kvothe said, their voice filled with wonder. "The magic is responding. It's learning to balance, to share, to flow. And I'm... I'm helping. I'm actually helping."

*They're finding their purpose,* you realized. *They're discovering that they can be more than a guardian who locks things away. They can be someone who helps magic flow, who helps people find joy.*

The magic began to stabilize, to find balance. Not perfect balance—it might never be perfect—but stable balance. The kind that could last, that could grow, that could adapt. And Kvothe was part of it, their understanding, their connection, their willingness to try.

"I think I understand now," Kvothe said. "My purpose isn't to protect people from disappointment. It's to help them find strength, find joy, even when things are hard. It's to help the magic flow, to help it find balance, to help it remember what Christmas really means."

*They're getting it,* you thought. *They're understanding who they are, what they want to be. And they're doing it with support, with connection, with help.*

What do you do?
