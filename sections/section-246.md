# Ignored Problems

You decided to ignore the problems and focus only on celebration, to pretend everything was fine, to not address the challenges. You thought the celebration was more important, that problems could wait. You ignored them.

*The celebration is more important,* you thought. *Problems can wait.*

But ignoring problems only made them worse, escalating, threatening the magic. Eventually, everything fell apart, and the celebration ended in disaster.

*The problems are getting worse,* you thought. *Everything is falling apart.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You ignored the problems," it said, its voice sad. "But problems don't go away when ignored. They escalate, threatening everything. You ignored them, and everything fell apart."

*I ignored them,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the problems remain—escalated, threatening, a reminder that ignoring problems doesn't make them go away, that addressing them is more important than ignoring.
