# Overwhelming Everyone

You decided to try to teach everyone at once to speed things up, to not take time, to rush. You thought you could teach them all quickly, that you could do it faster. You rushed, trying to teach everyone.

*I can teach them all quickly,* you thought. *I just need to rush.*

But rushing only made everyone overwhelmed, confused, unable to learn. The teaching became ineffective, and people never really understood.

*They're all overwhelmed,* you thought. *They can't learn.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You rushed," it said, its voice sad. "But teaching takes time, patience, individual attention. You rushed, and everyone became overwhelmed, unable to learn. The teaching was ineffective."

*I rushed,* you realized. *I failed to teach them.*

The story ends here, but the teaching remains ineffective—everyone overwhelmed, a reminder that rushing is not the answer, that patience is more important than speed.
