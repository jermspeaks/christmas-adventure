# Returning to Starlight Hollow

You returned to Starlight Hollow, the Keepsake Keeper warm in your hands, Lumina trotting at your side. The town looked different now—the magic had transformed it, but the people seemed confused, uncertain. They could feel the magic, could see it, but they didn't understand it.

*They need help,* you realized. *They need to understand what the magic is now, how it works, what it means.*

You walked through the town, and you could see the confusion on people's faces. They were trying to use the magic the old way, trying to control it, trying to make it do what they wanted. But it wasn't responding. It was just... waiting. Like it was asking them to connect, to remember, to feel.

*They don't understand,* you thought. *They're trying to use the old magic, but the magic has changed. It's not about control anymore—it's about connection, about memory, about emotion.*

Lumina trotted forward, their eyes bright. "The people are confused," they said. "They can feel the magic, but they don't understand it. They're trying to use it the old way, but it doesn't work like that anymore. They need help."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed warmly. "The magic has been transformed," it said. "It's different now—it's about connection, about memory, about emotion. It can't be controlled—it must be shared. But the people don't understand that yet. They need someone to help them understand, to guide them, to teach them."

*So I need to help them,* you thought. *I need to help them understand what the magic is now, how it works, what it means. I need to guide them, to teach them, to help them learn to connect, to remember, to share.*

You approached the town square, where people were gathered, talking in hushed, confused voices. They looked at you with hope and uncertainty, like they were waiting for answers, for guidance, for someone to help them understand.

What do you do?
