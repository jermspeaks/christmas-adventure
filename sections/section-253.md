# Total Control

You decided to try to control the magic and community completely, to be in charge of everything, to make all decisions. You thought you knew what was best, that you should control it all. You tried to control everything.

*I know what's best,* you thought. *I should control it all.*

But trying to control everything only made everyone resist, rebel, reject you. The magic rejected you too, cutting you off completely. You lost everything.

*They're all resisting,* you thought. *The magic is rejecting me.*

The Memory Keeper's light died. "You tried to control everything," it said, its voice fading. "But magic and community require freedom, connection, sharing. You tried to control it all, and everyone rejected you, the magic rejected you. You lost everything."

*I tried to control it all,* you realized. *I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but you remain alone—rejected by everyone, rejected by magic, a reminder that control is not the answer, that freedom is more important than control.
