# Ripples of Change

The magic continued to flow, steady and controlled, spreading across the world like a gentle wave. You watched as the lights of Starlight Hollow brightened, as the forest around you came alive with sparkle and song, as the very air seemed to shimmer with possibility.

*It's beautiful,* you thought. *It's working exactly as it should.*

But then you noticed something. The Memory Keeper's light, which had been so bright and steady, began to flicker. Not in a way that suggested it was failing, but in a way that suggested... something else. Something new.

"The magic is restored," the Memory Keeper said, its voice thoughtful. "But as I said, this will create ripples. The magic has been gone for so long that bringing it back all at once... well, it's going to cause some changes. Some of them might be unexpected."

*Unexpected changes?* you thought. *What kind of changes?*

As if in answer, you heard a sound from the direction of Starlight Hollow—not the joyful sounds of celebration you'd expected, but something else. Shouts. Confusion. The sound of things happening that shouldn't be happening.

Lumina's ears perked up, and they looked toward the town with concern. "Something's wrong," they said. "The magic is back, but... it's doing things. Strange things. I can feel it from here."

Kael, who had been watching the magic flow with a look of wonder, suddenly frowned. "The magic is too strong in some places," they said. "And too weak in others. It's like... it's like it doesn't know where to go, or how much to give. The world has changed since the magic was locked away. It's not the same place it was before."

You looked at the Memory Keeper, which was now pulsing in a pattern you didn't recognize. "What's happening?" you asked.

"The magic is trying to restore itself," the Memory Keeper explained. "But the world it's returning to is different from the world it left. Some places have forgotten how to hold magic. Others are trying to take too much. And there are... gaps. Places where the magic should be, but isn't, because the connection has been broken for too long."

*So restoring the magic isn't the end,* you realized. *It's just the beginning. Now we have to help the world adjust, help the magic find its balance again.*

In the distance, you could see lights flickering in Starlight Hollow—some too bright, some too dim, some flickering in patterns that made no sense. The magic was back, but it wasn't stable. It needed guidance. It needed someone to help it find its way.

*And that someone,* you thought, *is probably us.*

What do you do?
