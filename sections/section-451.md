# Wrong Path

You thought you were following the trail correctly, confident that you knew where you were going. You followed the path of fading magic, sure that it would lead you to the Memory Vault.

*I'm on the right track,* you thought. *This is definitely the way.*

But as you walked deeper into the forest, you began to realize something was wrong. The trail seemed to be leading you in circles. The Keepsake Keeper's light was getting dimmer, not brighter. The path felt wrong, like you were going the opposite direction from where you needed to be.

*This doesn't feel right,* you thought, but you weren't sure.

Lumina, who had been following you, looked concerned. "Are you sure this is the right way?" they asked. "The trail seems... off. Like it's leading us away from the vault, not toward it."

*What if they're right?* you wondered. *What if I'm going the wrong way?*

What do you do?
