# Ignored Guidance

You ignored the Memory Keeper's warnings, thinking you knew better, that you didn't need its guidance. You pushed forward, ignoring its advice, its concern, its wisdom.

*I don't need its warnings,* you thought. *I can handle this.*

But the Memory Keeper's warnings were there for a reason. The path was dangerous, and without its guidance, you quickly found yourself lost. You went the wrong way, you made mistakes, you put yourself in danger.

*This is worse than I thought,* you realized, but it was too late.

The Memory Keeper's light faded, unable to help you anymore. You became lost, unable to find the Memory Vault, unable to help. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever.

*I should have listened,* you thought. *I should have heeded the Memory Keeper's warnings.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that guidance is essential, that warnings exist for a reason, that listening is more important than knowing.
