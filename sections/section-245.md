# Abandoned Community

You decided to give up when the community faced challenges, to stop trying, to walk away. You thought it was too hard, that you couldn't help. You gave up.

*It's too hard,* you thought. *I'm giving up.*

But giving up only made the community struggle more, lose hope, lose the magic. Everything fell apart, and there was no way to fix it.

*Everything is falling apart,* you thought. *I can't fix it.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You gave up," it said, its voice sad. "But communities need support, help, persistence. You gave up, and the community struggled, lost hope, lost the magic. Everything fell apart."

*I gave up,* you realized. *I destroyed everything.*

The story ends here, but the community remains broken—struggling, hope lost, a reminder that giving up is not the answer, that persistence is more important than giving up.
