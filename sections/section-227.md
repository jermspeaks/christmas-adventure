# Hollow Magic

You decided to ignore the connection aspect, to just use the magic without connecting, without remembering, without feeling. You thought you could use it like a tool, that you didn't need to connect. You ignored the connection.

*I don't need to connect,* you thought. *I can just use it.*

But ignoring the connection only made the magic hollow, meaningless. It lost its power, its meaning, its purpose. The magic became empty, useless, dead.

*It's not working,* you thought. *The magic is empty.*

The Memory Keeper's light dimmed. "You ignored the connection," it said, its voice sad. "But the magic requires connection, memory, emotion. Without it, the magic becomes hollow, meaningless, dead. You ignored it, and the magic died."

*I ignored the connection,* you realized. *I killed the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains dead—hollow, meaningless, a reminder that connection is essential, that meaning is more important than use.
