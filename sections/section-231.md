# Broken Connections

You decided to break connections with others to focus on yourself, to be independent, to not need anyone. You thought you could do it alone, that connections were holding you back. You broke the connections.

*I don't need anyone,* you thought. *I can do it alone.*

But breaking connections only made the magic fade from you. It required connection, sharing, togetherness. Without it, the magic left you, fading away completely.

*The magic is fading,* you thought. *It's leaving me.*

The Keepsake Keeper's light dimmed. "You broke the connections," it said, its voice sad. "But the magic requires connection, sharing, togetherness. Without it, the magic fades. You broke them, and the magic left you, fading away completely."

*I broke them,* you realized. *I lost the magic.*

The story ends here, but the magic remains gone—faded from you, a reminder that connection is essential, that togetherness is more important than independence.
