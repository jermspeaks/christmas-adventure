# Shared Joy

You threw yourself into celebration, sharing the joy with Kvothe, focusing on the positive, the happy, the wonderful. *This is what we should focus on,* you thought. *The joy, the celebration, the magic. Not the pain, not the past, not the struggle.*

You and Kvothe celebrated together, laughing, sharing memories, feeling the magic flow. The transformation was happening, but it was wrapped in joy, in celebration, in the positive emotions of the moment.

*This is good,* you thought. *They're transforming, and it's joyful. They're happy. This is what transformation should be.*

But as time passed, you began to notice something. Kvothe was happy, yes, but there was something underneath—a fragility, a hesitation. Like they were holding something back, like they were avoiding something they needed to face.

*They're happy,* you thought. *But are they really processing? Are they really understanding what they're becoming, or are they just celebrating and avoiding the harder parts?*

Cheshire trotted forward, their eyes gentle. "Celebration is important," they said. "Joy is important. But transformation isn't just about joy—it's also about processing, about understanding, about facing the harder parts. Sometimes you need to feel the pain to fully understand the joy."

The Keepsake Keeper pulsed thoughtfully. "Joy is wonderful," it said. "But transformation requires both joy and processing. You need to celebrate, but you also need to understand, to process, to face the harder parts. Sometimes focusing only on joy means avoiding the processing that needs to happen."

*So maybe I need to help them process,* you thought. *Not just celebrate, but also help them understand, help them face the harder parts, help them process what they're going through.*

You looked at Kvothe, at their joy, at their celebration. But you also saw the fragility, the hesitation, the things they might be avoiding. *They need to process,* you realized. *They need to face the harder parts, not just celebrate the joyful ones.*

What do you do?
