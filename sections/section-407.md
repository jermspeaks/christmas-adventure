# Ignored Warnings

You took the supplies from Elara but ignored their warnings. You thought the supplies were enough, that you didn't need to listen to their advice, their concern, their wisdom.

*I have the supplies,* you thought. *That's enough.*

But Elara's warnings were important. The forest was dangerous, and without heeding their advice, you quickly found yourself in trouble. You used the supplies incorrectly, you made mistakes, you put yourself in danger.

*This is worse than I thought,* you realized, but it was too late.

The supplies weren't enough without the knowledge of how to use them. You became lost, unable to find the Memory Vault, unable to help. The magic continued to fade, and Christmas Eve arrived. The magic disappeared completely, and Christmas faded forever.

*I should have listened,* you thought. *I should have heeded Elara's warnings.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that supplies without knowledge are useless, that warnings are important, that listening is essential.
