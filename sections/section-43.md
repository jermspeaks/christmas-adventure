# Talking to Officer Martinez

Officer Sarah Martinez was young, maybe in her early thirties, with sharp eyes that missed nothing. She'd been assigned to the case, and you could tell she took her job seriously.

"I understand you found the body," she said, her tone professional but not unkind. "And the dog led you here?"

"Yuzu," you said, and the dog in question looked up at the sound of his name, his tail giving a tentative wag. "He found the note. And the letter opener."

Officer Martinez made a note. "We'll need to talk to everyone who was in the shop. But I have to ask—what were you doing here? And why did you follow the dog?"

*Good question,* you thought. *Why did I follow the dog?* But you had, and now you were here, and something about the whole situation felt like it wasn't over yet.

You told her everything—how you'd been browsing the shop, how Yuzu had led you to the office, how you'd found Eleanor. You showed her the torn note fragment, told her about the letter opener, about what you'd observed.

Officer Martinez listened carefully, taking notes. "You've been very observant," she said. "That's helpful. But I need to ask you to let the police handle the investigation from here. This is a crime scene, and we need to process it properly."

*But I've already found things,* you thought. *I've already noticed things. I can't just stop now.*

"I understand," you said. "But I've found some things that might be important. The torn note, the letter opener, Eleanor's journal, a business card for a rare book dealer named Alistair Finch..."

Officer Martinez's expression changed slightly. "Alistair Finch? We've been looking into him. He's been harassing Eleanor for weeks, sending threatening letters. We found more of them in her office."

*So Alistair Finch had motive,* you thought. *But he also had an alibi, according to what you'd heard. He was at an auction in the city, with dozens of witnesses.*

"What about Marcus?" you asked. "Or Beatrice? They were both here when it happened."

"We're looking into everyone," Officer Martinez said. "But I need you to let us do our job. This is a murder investigation, not a game."

*It's not a game to me either,* you thought. *Eleanor is dead. Someone killed her. And I want to find out who.*

What do you do?
