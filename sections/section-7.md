# Understanding the Problem

You had questions—lots of them. "How is the magic being stolen?" you asked. "And why me? Why am I the one who needs to help?"

Cheshire's expression softened, and they let out a small, almost musical sigh. "Good questions. Let me explain as best I can."

They settled more comfortably in the snow, as if preparing for a long conversation. "The magic here works like... well, think of it like a garden. It needs to be tended, nurtured, shared. For centuries, the magic has flowed naturally through this world, making Christmas possible—the joy, the wonder, the way people come together. But someone, or something, has been taking that magic and hoarding it. Not using it, just... keeping it locked away."

Cheshire gestured with a paw toward the village in the distance. "You can see the effects already. The lights in the windows flicker because the magic that keeps them bright is fading. The snow doesn't sparkle quite as much. Even the stars above are dimmer than they should be. And it's getting worse every day."

They looked at you with those ancient, knowing eyes. "As for why you... well, that's the interesting part. The magic chose you. When you touched that book, it recognized something in you—a spark, a connection. You're not from this world, which means you're not bound by its rules. You can go places and do things that we can't. And you have something that's been missing here: fresh perspective, genuine wonder."

Cheshire's voice grew more urgent, though still warm. "The consequences, if we fail? Christmas won't just disappear here. It will fade everywhere. The warmth people feel, the joy of giving, the wonder of the season—all of it will simply... stop. Not dramatically, not with a bang. Just a slow, quiet fading until there's nothing left but ordinary days in December."

They stood up, shaking snow from their fur. "But we have three days. Three days to find where the magic is being kept and restore it. It's not much time, but it's enough. If we work together."

What do you do?
