# Refusal

You refused to help. "This isn't my problem," you said. "I didn't ask for this. I don't want to be involved."

Lumina's expression fell, and you saw disappointment in their eyes. "I understand," they said quietly. "But the magic will fade. Christmas will disappear. Not just here, but everywhere. And there's no one else who can help."

*That's not my problem,* you thought, turning away.

But as you walked away, you felt the magic fading faster. The lights dimmed. The snow lost its sparkle. The world became colder, emptier, less magical. And you realized, too late, that you'd made a terrible mistake.

*I should have helped,* you thought, but it was too late.

The magic faded completely, and Christmas disappeared forever. The world became ordinary, cold, empty. And you were left with the knowledge that you could have helped, that you could have made a difference, but you chose not to.

*I chose not to help,* you realized. *And I lost everything.*

The story ends here, but the world remains without magic—forever, a reminder that refusing to help when you can is a choice, and choices have consequences.
