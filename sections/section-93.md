# False Ending: Incomplete Investigation

You thought you had enough. You'd found some evidence, you'd talked to some people, you'd formed a theory. You were ready to solve the case.

But as you presented your findings to Officer Martinez, you realized you didn't have enough. Your evidence was circumstantial. Your theory was based on assumptions. You hadn't verified anything. You hadn't gathered all the pieces.

*I rushed,* you thought. *I wanted to solve it so badly that I didn't take the time to do it right.*

Officer Martinez looked at your evidence, and she shook her head. "This isn't enough," she said. "You have some interesting leads, but you haven't proven anything. You need more evidence. You need to verify your facts. You need to be certain before you accuse anyone."

*But I thought I was certain,* you thought. *I thought I had it figured out.*

But you didn't. You had pieces, but not the whole picture. You had suspicions, but not proof. You had a theory, but not the evidence to back it up.

*I need to go back,* you thought. *I need to gather more evidence. I need to verify everything. I need to be certain.*

You looked at Yuzu, who was watching you with those bright, intelligent eyes. *He knows,* you thought. *He knows I'm not ready. He knows I need to keep looking.*

*I should have been more thorough,* you thought. *I should have gathered all the evidence before I tried to solve the case. I should have been patient.*

What do you do?
